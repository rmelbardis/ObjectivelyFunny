       "' Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your host for tonight, Frankie Boyle! CHEERING Hello! AUDIENCE: Hello! Hello and welcome to Live At The Apollo. I\\'m quite surprised that they\\'ve let me on as well, if that\\'s any comfort. HE LAUGHS I\\'ve got a lovely theatre, I\\'ve got two fantastic comedians to introduce to you tonight, I\\'ve got a lovely audience to talk to... I looked right into your eyes when I said that, mate. How you doing? You have made an effort there, haven\\'t you, man? You have made an effort with the Peaky Blinders hairstyle there. And it\\'s like putting 26-inch rims on a wheelie bin. We\\'ve got some famous celebrities to talk to tonight. And some not-so famous. Some of the celebrities here tonight, when I was researching the show, I had to start their Wikipedia page. There are celebrities in here who don\\'t get asked to turn on the Christmas lights in their own house. You\\'re talking about people who are 18 months away from being quite a tricky tie-breaker in a pub quiz. I\\'m only kidding. We\\'re got some, er, famous faces in. Who have we got? We\\'ve got Jameela Jamil. How you doing, Jameela? You all right? It\\'s exciting for me, cos you present the Radio One Chart Show. You get to tell the nation what is number one every week. And the only way that could be more exciting, I think, would be if it was 20 years ago, when anybody gave a shit. Who else have we got? We\\'ve got people from Holby, haven\\'t we? We\\'ve got Hugh Quarshie. Where\\'s Hugh? Hugh, how you doing? You\\'re a fantastic actor. You\\'ve been in the RSC and everything. You\\'ve been in Holby for a long time, right, so I have a theory that if someone had a heart attack over here, we could whisk you over and just suck all of the drama out of the situation. We had the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this year, a great choice of venue. A place where people think that hepatitis B is a vitamin. I don\\'t really trust these big sporting occasions, you know? The Olympics - a lot of that stuff is just for rich people. Dressage. Yachting. I don\\'t remember that at school. -POSHLY:-Yachting tomorrow class so remember, bring in your boats. A lot of people find the Paralympics inspiring. I just found it depressing. I can\\'t throw a discus and I\\'ve got arms. Oscar Pistorius. Pistorius, to me, sounds like a spell that Harry Potter would say to make your legs drop off. When he gets out of jail, his next girlfriend is going to get ready in a hurry. \"I thought you were running a bath?\" \"No, I just threw some dungarees on. Let\\'s go!\" I hope a jail bully steals his legs, walks about being nine foot six. I don\\'t like the Commonwealth cos the Commonwealth is the old British Empire. It\\'s called the Commonwealth because Britain stole all those countries\\' wealth and then went, \"Come on!\" The whole Empire was founded on cocaine. Everybody was on cocaine. The remedies had cocaine in them. Queen Victoria was on cocaine. And not the shit you take! You\\'ve never done a line and gone, \"Let\\'s invade India!\" We had the referendum up in Scotland. It was won by the No Campaign and Alistair Darling. I thought it\\'d be good if when he won, Alistair Darling\\'s eyebrows had finally turned into butterflies. And he wasn\\'t even able to look surprised about it. David Beckham sent the people of Scotland an open letter. An open letter because he couldn\\'t work out how to get it into the envelope. People said that during the campaign that I was anti-English. I couldn\\'t be more pro-English. I thought the best thing for independence would have been if England had won the World Cup. Cos you would have been so unbearable that we would have to leave. Whatever happens next, I think it\\'s important that Scotland does something that puts England on the back foot, something that England won\\'t expect. And the last thing that you\\'re expecting is for us to form an Islamic Caliphate. IS - Independent Scotland. We can do this. OK, we\\'ll have to learn how to treat women slightly better, but we can change. I think people don\\'t understand enough about international politics, do they? In Scotland, people think that Nato is just a nickname you give to a guy who lost a foot to diabetes. -Keep up. -HE LAUGHS Ed Miliband came up for the referendum. Now I\\'m going to go out on a limb here and say I don\\'t think Ed Miliband will win the election. Because if he can\\'t persuade his own face to do what he tells it to... Ed Miliband said he wanted to militarise the Scottish border. Can you imagine being a Scottish border guard, having to do cavity searches just to keep your hands warm. Holding back the English refugees at Newcastle. Newcastle being the first city in history that turned into a refugee camp, and got less mental. -IN NEWCASTLE ACCENT:-Well, things are actually a lot more civilised now that we\\'re ruled over by a horse militia. Do you know what people in Scotland want? What they really want in my experience is they want transport to run normally in the winter through three feet of snow. That\\'s all they ever moan about - \"Why isn\\'t this train moving through the snow?\" But what you really want is for the pilot to come over the intercom and go, \"Well, I\\'ve been told that it\\'s not safe to take off, \"but I thought, let\\'s give it a go.\" We live in a kind of porn culture now. Don\\'t we? You see that thing on porn search engines, where it goes, \"Make this your home page.\" Who does that? Who wakes up in the morning, switches their computer on, is confronted with hardcore pornography and thinks, \"I\\'m home!\" Animals don\\'t watch porn, do they? Unless you include my cat. I think what it\\'s led to... It\\'s led to men not really understanding what sex is like for women any more. I often think it must be more intense to let someone inside your body. I feel awkward just letting the gas man into the hallway. I feel awkward just talking about sex cos I\\'m so old and disgusting I have a body like a dropped lasagne. I\\'m 42 and I now ejaculate with all the force of Mary Berry\\'s icing piper. I honestly think I\\'m so old that I couldn\\'t even be viewed sexually any more. I think if I walked down the street with my hand down the front of my trousers, people would just assume that I was rummaging for a dropped toffee. If you get offended by any jokes tonight, by the way, feel free to tweet your outrage on a mobile phone made by a ten-year-old in China. Cos that\\'s what Santa Claus does the other 364 days q year. He travels round the world apologising to all the children who actually make the presents. \"Sorry about that, Wo Ling Ho. \"Still, tea break\\'s over. Back to work, son.\" People say that Steve Jobs died too soon. But I think it was a fitting metaphor for his company\\'s attitude to battery life. I hope that they buried him in a coffin with a great big crack in the lid. Twitter\\'s good, though, isn\\'t it? I enjoy Twitter. Before Twitter came along, if I wanted to be called a wanker by a stranger, I had to go out for a walk. Do you know what gets me on Twitter? Those wee biogs people have where they put the most banal, depressing summations of themselves. \"Tea drinker, that\\'s me in a nutshell. \"I like to drink a cup of tea.\" \"Foodie, I eat food.\" I want a burst of honesty in one of those boxes. \"I was brought up in an atmosphere of such violence that \"I could never truly love anyone. \"The only person who loved me I rejected, and during my ensuing \"mental breakdown, I got a nutcase pregnant. \"I also drink tea.\" I\\'d never even understood that Twitter was a bird metaphor, even though it\\'s got a bird as the icon and they\\'re called tweets. I think the reason I\\'d never worked that out is I\\'ve never gone to the park and had a little robin redbreast turn round in its nest and tell me that it hopes that my kids die because I made a joke about Michael Schumacher. It was actually a very gentle joke about Michael Schumacher. I mean, thank God he\\'s better and everything, but at the time I tweeted, \"The only hope for Michael Schumacher is \"if his brain is repaired overnight by elves.\" So it was actually a very light-hearted Elves And The Shoemaker joke. You can\\'t please all of the people all of the time, can you? Some people just get offended by a word! They don\\'t want a word in a joke. \"No, ban that word.\" I can train a dog to get angry at a word. \"Rover, Jehovah\\'s witnesses.\" People should be more sophisticated. Different words mean different things to different people. You say Snapchat, I say speed wank. Then there\\'s the thing called phenomenology. Phenomenology means that the joke can\\'t take place in my mouth, if you think about it, it has to take place in your head, so it\\'s often better in your head because you add to it. I had this a couple of weeks ago. I helped an old guy across the road in Glasgow. He went to me, \"Help me across the road, son, \"I\\'ve got aids in both ears.\" HE LAUGHS Read a thing that said a woman died after drinking 18 litres of Coke. She ate a packet of Mentos and they found her head three miles away. Piers Morgan says that women send him knickers through the post. Presumably with the message, \"From one twat to another.\" I don\\'t really understand TV, to be honest. I don\\'t understand why Ant and Dec go to the jungle every year when it\\'s the only place that\\'s hot enough for Ant\\'s head to hatch. I don\\'t understand why Alan Sugar looks like he\\'s been cleaned out of someone\\'s belly button. I\\'d love to see how big Alan Sugar was if you ironed him. HE LAUGHS There\\'s a thing that happens to you, I think, in your forties as a man where you suddenly realise that you\\'re a dad. And not in a good way. You realise that you\\'re a 42-year-old father-of-two who says lame dad stuff. And you will never be cool again. And this happened to me last week. I was in Covent Garden and I was trying to cross the road at the traffic lights. There was a guy beside me, a beautiful male model. A Californian guy. A beautiful man. And because he was American, he was looking the wrong way into traffic. And he stepped out in front of a moving car. And I grabbed him by the arm and pulled him back onto the pavement and he had no idea how close he\\'d come to dying. And he said, \"What was that car\\'s problem?\" And I went, \"Look both ways, Zoolander!\" Do you know what my kids got me for Fathers\\' Day? They got me that shower gel, mint tea tree gel. No-one had warned me about that. I thought my arsehole was going to burst into song! They always say, don\\'t they, when you\\'re telling your kids off, stay positive. Don\\'t be too negative. And I agree with that. But sometimes you\\'re standing there thinking, \"I don\\'t see anything positive about this. \"You have shat on my rug... \"and I am struggling to find an upside.\" You can\\'t hit your kids, obviously, but there\\'s nothing that says that you can\\'t tamper with the brakes on their heelies. My son\\'s six now so it\\'s actually quite difficult to punish him. What I do is I tuck his bedclothes in really, really tight and hope that he has a nightmare where he\\'s trapped in a giant\\'s pocket. I think it\\'s sad when people medicate their children for behavioural problems, when it\\'s so much easier to just drug yourself. You know the saddest thing? You spend the first year teaching them to say Dad. \"Say Dad, Daddy, Dada.\" And now they\\'re like, \"DAAAAD!\" And I\\'m like, \"Shut up, will you? \"I\\'m on Tinder trying to find us a new mum.\" We\\'re bombing Iraq now. We\\'re calling it humanitarian bombing. There\\'s no such thing as humanitarian bombing, is there? It\\'s always about oil or power. Not humanitarianism. That\\'s why you never get stopped by someone in the streets saying, \"Hi, I\\'m from Oxfam and for just £12 a month, \"we could really blow the shit out of something.\" And who are we blowing up? IS? Remember last year they said, \"Oh, we need to bomb Syria. \"Help the rebels. They\\'re the good guys.\" Who were the rebels? IS. The same people. They\\'ve gone from being loved to hated and despised in a year and they haven\\'t even had to win the X Factor to make that happen. Britain as a culture runs on hypocrisy. David Cameron went to Sri Lanka. He told the Sri Lankans off for human rights abuses that they committed with weapons that Britain sold to them. Like Ronald McDonald calling you a fat bastard. We sent Prince Harry to Afghanistan, because when you want to teach people about democracy, you send them a prince! You teach them about peace and democracy by having a prince shoot at them from a helicopter! -You ready for your first act, ladies and gentlemen? -CHEERING Please, give it up and show a lot of love to '"

Is that one of the hazards of hurdling? Welcome, Colin. Nice to have you here. Oh, the lovely Esther Rantzen is here. -Hello, Miss Esther, how are you? -I'm good, thanks. -Very nice to have you here. Unfortunately, if you don't like this show there is not any complaining procedure. Sorry, but that's...life. Welcome, welcome. Before we start, I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I come from quite a big family. There are eight kids in the family. Now, what can I tell you about that? Well, my dad loved the Jackson Five. And, quite clearly, sex. Very, very tough existence. I remember as a young kid saying to my dad, \"Dad, dad, with so many kids in the family there's not enough money. \"Can I have some pocket money?\" My dad would look at me and go, \"Shut up, bastard! \"Your pocket is for your hand.\" That's not the sort of thing you tell a teenage boy with holes in his pocket. I'd say to my dad, \"Dad, what does the future hold?\" He'd sit me down and go, \"One day, son, \"people will hang televisions \"off their walls as though they were pictures.\" I'd be like, \"Dad, what's a picture?\" I'd say to my mum, \"Mum, all the other kids are playing outside. \"Can I play outside?\" My mum would go, \"Shut up, bastard! \"Go upstairs and read a book.\" We had one book. The phone book. I read it. Wasn't a great read. I don't want to spoil it for you. Lots of characters. And at the end, a lot of Polish people turn up. Parents are very, very strange. Even little things. If we, as a family, played Monopoly, right, and I landed on jail, my dad would make me stand in the cupboard under the stairs to add a bit of realism. I remember when I got one of those Community Chest cards. It said, \"You've been caught speeding. £60 fine.\" My dad looked at me and went, \"Go upstairs to your bedroom and think about what you have done.\" My dad has mellowed later on in life. My dad is now 75 years old and we are getting on. We are getting on. But a couple of things about him I've now noticed, as he's gotten older, the level and volume of his sneezing has increased exponentially. And I don't know if you know this, but a sneeze is one-eighth of an orgasm. So when I hear my dad sneezing now, I just think, \"He's never had it so good!\" It's really hard to get him out of the house. I'm like, \"Dad, dad, let's go to the pub. \"What do you think?\" He'd go, \"No, I'm going to have a quiet evening in with the pepper pot.\" Being a child from a big family, I had loads of brothers and sisters. Anyone here who's got an older brother, you'll know that you believed EVERYTHING your older brother said. He was my God. My older brother told me stuff that I believed. My older brother once told me that people on TV could see you as well. It was so embarrassing. I could never, ever watch Baywatch again. Yes, David Hasselhoff knew too much. And also he'd say things like, \"You know, the milkman has got his own special udder. \"You should go and pull it.\" I pulled it. Social services were called. And we never saw the milkman again. Very, very tough existence. But, at school, you want to fit in and I was very, very paranoid cos at school I had really big feet, massive feet. So, for three years, as a kid at school, I wore shoes three sizes too small. Would you believe it, later on in life, I've got a crooked cock. Some of you now are trying to process that! \"How did he walk?\" But also at school, I wanted a teacher... Do we have any teachers here this evening? Any teachers? SHOUTS AND CHEERS Yes, what age group do you teach? Secondary? Respect to you. Respect. -What subject?-Maths. -So you do maths, and you? Science. Respect. I asked that same question at a show yesterday, lady at the front went, \"Yeah, I do primary.\" I went, \"Listen, love, you're not a teacher. You're a helper. \"Let me guess, what subject do you teach?\" \"Everything.\" I wanted a teacher at school who was inspiring. A teacher like Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society. Instead, I got a teacher like Robin Williams in a Mrs Doubtfire. We weren't even allowed to go on any school trips. Anybody go on school trips? Yeah, where did you go, sir? -The beach.-The beach?! That really doesn't help me at all. \"Beach! \"We go trip beach!\" -Where are you from, sir?-Kent. Kent. OK, beach. I shouldn't disparage. I digress. I once went on a family holiday many years ago. Obviously, as I said, there were so many kids in the family that the only memory of family holidays is the smell of petrol, right? With all us kids in the car, my dad would put me and my sister in the boot. Yeah? After four hours in the boot, I'd go, \"Dad, dad, can you guess where we are yet?\" And he'd go, \"Shut up, bastard! \"We're on the motorway and if you are talking, you're not hiding.\" -It was a family holiday in Margate, back in the old days. -CHEERING Oh, please, don't cheer Margate. I haven't finished. I'm talking the late '70s, right? All the family traipsed down there, arrived in Margate, miserable weather, horrible food, rainy, windy. We walked along the beachfront and this random bloke comes up to us and goes, \"Oi, you lot! \"Why don't you go back to where you came from?\" And I was like, \"Don't you think I've asked myself the very same question?\" But then fast forward to this year and I've had two holidays already. Two holidays. I went to America. Mmm, boom! Yes, but I don't know if you know this, folks, but in America there is no point of reference for a black British person, right? I was in a cafe in America. I said, \"I'd like a cappuccino, please.\" The guy behind the desk went, \"Oh, my God! \"It's Jeffrey from the Fresh Prince!\" Don't applaud that. I look nothing like him! In fact, a friend said to me that I look like a black Alan Sugar. No, say it ain't so! One of the reasons I went to America is because my favourite drink is Jack Daniels. So I went to the birthplace of Jack Daniels, which is where? -ALL: Tennessee.-Thank you. Whereabouts in Tennessee? Lynchburg. It's OK, folks, what's done is done. But how much does it cost to change a sign? I went to the Jack Daniel's distillery. They could answer all my questions. How long is the ageing process? How long does it take to go through all the charcoal? The one question they couldn't answer was, \"Why is this place still called Lynchburg? \"Come on, guys, don't leave me hanging.\" And I also went to Nigeria. My parents are from Nigeria and it was quite an experience. I arrived at immigration with my two earrings, right? The immigration took one look at me and went, \"Ah, are you a man or a woman?\" I said, \"I'm quite clearly a man.\" And he said, \"Shame. With your powerful legs and your broad shoulders, \"you make a beautiful lady.\" The things I've done for a visa. Angela. My good friend, Angela Griffin's here. Hi, Ange. All right? We like Ange, yeah? In the house. I loved you in Coronation Street. -You played a hairdresser. -That's right. And in Cutting It you played a hairdresser. -A beautician, actually. -A beautician? Quite similar. What a range. I've been on tour, as well, folks, and I've seen all of the country. I travelled on various means of transport. I took the train. Oh, my God! When I took the train as a kid, it was only so my mum could beat us in public. \"Think yourself lucky. \"Other children are merely beaten at home. \"I'm beating you as you gaze out on to beautiful scenery.\" And the trains now, aren't they so high-tech? Oh, my God. You now get a socket by your seat. A socket by your seat. If you're on a train, there is a socket by your seat. Use it to the max. Get your ironing done. Blow-dry your hair. When I now travel on the train, I take a kettle and George Foreman grill. Yeah, I can knock out coffee and sandwiches cheaper than the buffet car. And television, I'm really a big fan of TV, right. People are now saying that apparently young people are being influenced by what they see on TV. And any parents here, you might remember this, there is a cartoon called Peppa Pig. -Anybody know that cartoon? -CHEERING Yeah. People are applauding a cartoon! \"Oh yes!\" And what it was, they had to re-edit two of the episodes cos apparently Peppa Pig was seen driving a car without a seatbelt. Yeah. We had Roadrunner! He jumped off buildings. If you've got a child who copies what they see on adverts, that's called natural selection. Get rid. Get another one. Back in the old days, '70s, '80s, all our bits of technology were built into bits of furniture. Look at people nodding. Yes! Is it any wonder the rainforest is now depleting? The stereo in our lounge was built under so much mahogany that I thought if I lifted the lid I would discover a lost Amazonian tribe. \"Mum, look, \"a man with a plate in his lip has just shot a dart in my face.\" \"Shut up, he's your father.\" When I was growing up, we had one telephone in the house, in the hallway. Anybody my age remember that? One telephone. I'd be like that, \"Listen, I can't talk for long, Dad is staring at me. \"Dad, dad, can I have some privacy?\" And he'd go, \"Privacy? \"Buy your own house!\" One thing I remember from school, though, teachers, yeah, finger painting. Remember that? I loved that. Cos I come from inner-city London, right? And it was only later on in life that I realised it was our headmaster's ingenious way to get our fingerprints early. He'd say, \"Most of you will go on to offend later on in life. \"I'm a merely cutting out the middleman.\" Also, one of the things I seem to remember from school, folks, right, one of the main things I remember is that I'm not a very sporty child. Not sporty at all. And it dawned on me, right, if you're a white kid at an all-black school, and you're not sporty, people assume you're academic. But if you're a black kid at an all-white school, you can't dance or sing, people assume you're adopted. The one thing I loved at school was the power of the note. Forget the man who invented the television. Forget him. Forget the man who invented the internet. The power of the note, the note could get you out of anything. PE? No, I've got a note. Jabs? I've got a note. If only the note could follow you later on in life. Can you imagine me in the military in a Chinook helicopter over Afghanistan? \"Private Amos, jump.\" \"I can't, I've got a note. \"Mum says don't jump. Not in these shoes. \"You get me?\" And the leader of the free world, Barack Obama, wow, look at that. If Barack Obama was a kid at my primary school and said to my careers adviser, \"I want to be the President\", the careers adviser would have gone, \"Well, O-bummer...\" Obviously a temporary careers adviser. \"..I can definitely see you on the campaign bus...driving it.\" Also, folks, I want to be a bit honest with you tonight. I'm very much into same-sex relationships cos I think it's very important that you're both into the same kind of sex. Otherwise it can create friction. GROANS APPLAUSE Thank you. People say to me, \"Steve, are you gay or bisexual?\" I go, \"Definitely gay, there's no two ways about it.\" That's one positive thing about being gay cos a lot of those skills are transferable. Is that too much? But my mum's take on it is this, if my mum saw me having sex with a man she'd be like this. \"Oh, the man my son is having sex with, HE is the gay one.\" That's my mum. But my friends, they are quite bad at trying to set me up. I say to them I like a man in uniform. Barry from B&Q wasn't quite what I had in mind. But, as I say, I'm having fun at the moment doing this job. Look at me, yeah, I've actually been asked to host Live At The Apollo! CHEERING And Lenny Henry isn't dead. No! He's just locked in a room at the Premiere Inn. OK, ladies and gentlemen, are we ready to start the show? CHEERING Ladies and gentlemen, please help me welcome my first guest on tonight. A very good friend of mine. A rising star on the comedy circuit. Please give it up for the comedy talents that are Mr John Richardson! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello. Hello. How are you? This is good, isn't it? Big! HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM Ooh, yeah! One of them as well. Why not? Very rare you get that response in a cardigan, but, you know. It's nice. It's times like this, as a stand-up, you realise, I think I basically just moan for a living. I'm going to make a concerted effort to be positive and happy cos that's what people like, apparently. And I get accused, I constantly get told I'm grumpy and miserable, and I'm not. I'm happy. I'm upbeat. I love being alive. Love being a human. Being a human's unbelievable, isn't it? If you're a human, you really have nothing to moan about. I realise this year that being a human is the best on the planet. I was on a plane eating a chicken sandwich. That's not it. It's pretty good, though. I thought, \"I am eating a bird whilst I am flying.\" Unbelievable. I, a flightless land mammal, am consuming a bird in mid-air. Never mind the fact I just ordered a gin and tonic in a cloud. Being a human's so easy that that's are why you get annoyed with people cos people don't seem to try as hard as I would like them to, about life. I am a perfectionist. Give us a cheer if you're a perfectionist. Fair few of you. The rest of you are annoying. You go around and make mistakes and you drop things and you laugh about it, cos you think it's part of life's rich tapestry. It isn't. You should be trying harder. I'm a massive perfectionist to the point that every mistake in my life counts the same. So, in my world, dropping a spoon is the same as running someone over. In that, you didn't mean to do it and you did it, so you have to get angry about it and make sure it never happens again. And I watch people make mistakes. I came into London last year to do some gigs and I was on the London Underground. I was on the Hammersmith and City line which, if you don't know London, is the line that goes from Hammersmith into the City. Cockneys really don't piss around when they're naming their things. \"I built a tube line, Gary. It goes from Hammersmith to the City.\" \"Oh, yeah, what you gonna call it?\" \"Don't muck about, Gary. Don't muck about.\" So anyway, I was on the Underground, sat down. I knew I needed six stops to get to where I was going and opposite me on are two young girls, they're all dressed up, going out for the evening. They're laughing, giggling, joking. They're generally pissing me off. I'm not a big fan of public shows of joy. My motto is, there's misery in this world, you just have to look for it. If something's broken, you can fix it and if it's untidy, you can tidy it. If someone's unhappy, you can make them laugh and you've made their day a bit better. Happy people are finished. You can't help them. If you're happy, don't go out, just stay at home and enjoy walls and ceilings. My real issue with the happy is it's happy people who make mistakes because they're so busy enjoying life they've forgotten to do it properly. So I was on the underground and these girls were laughing away. A perfect example because they are enjoying being together so much they haven't noticed they've got on completely the wrong train. So we are hurtling off in this direction and they should actually be going in this direction. About five minutes in, one of the girls cottoned on. She tapped her mate and went, LAUGHS HEARTILY \"We're on the...\" I would have been furious. Let's say it now - that's not funny, is it? What's happened there is you've just lost a big chunk of your life. The time you were going to spend doing the thing you left the house to do you will now spend correcting your ineptitude. I know some people would say once you've got on the wrong train, there's nothing you can do but laugh about it. The only reason you'd laugh in this situation is if you do this so often you've just had to learn to find it amusing. \"Done it again, what are we like?!\" I'll tell you. Shit at being alive. It wasn't just that they laughed initially, they laughed all through the conversation about the fact there was no line they could get that would hook them back round and they'd have to cross the track at the next stop and go back in the opposite direction. Then one of them went, \"You'll have to phone Neil and tell him we're going to be late. He won't believe this!\" Yes, he will. It's not a far-fetched anecdote, is it? Neil's an idiot if you phone him and go, \"We've got on the wrong train\", and he goes, \"No, it's never happened before!\" And they got off and they were still laughing. They got off at the next stop. I sat there thinking, \"This is unbelievable! \"If you're not going to let this ruin your day, I'm going to have to take one for the team here. \"Strap on a pair and learn from this mistake even though I didn't make it.\" I just started ranting in my chair. \"This is typical of the world, this is. \"Never mind laughing about it, the fact is, Neil is waiting for them.\" \"And I'll tell you why Neil is waiting for them, \"cos Neil got there in good time by getting the right frigging train. \"I've got no qualms with Neil, Neil's a good egg.\" I ranted for about 10 minutes. All I achieved in that 10 minutes was that I went straight through the stop I was meant to be getting off at. You would have to concede that that's mental illness, if you are allowing your own life to be ruined by mistakes you haven't even made. The worst thing about it is it means a relationship is out of the question because you can't go out with someone when you pick up on every mistake, people don't like it. My view on relationships and on people in general is this - There are two types of people in the world. Basically there are putters and leavers. If you are not sure which one you are, you'll find out if I ask you a question like \"Where are your keys?\" and you go, \"They are where I put them.\" You are a putter. And to sum up, you're a good human being. You work hard, you try hard, you are probably quite successful. The other group, the leavers, or shithead devils... To give them their full title. If you say to them, \"Where are your keys?\" They'll go, \"Wherever I left them!\" And you will die in an accident. That's just a fact, you have to know where things are. That is a fact. And here's the problem in relationships. You tend to find you get a putter with a lever. You can't have two putters together cos they will kill each other over which way the beans should face in the cupboard. \"They go westwards.\" \"Oh, do they? In your face?\" Of course, you can never have two leavers together cos they will die of dysentery. What you tend to find is you get a putter with a leaver. The most annoying thing about leavers is they are more fun to be around, they are happier people, because they go around dropping things and knocking stuff over and the putter goes, \"That goes there, that goes there. I'm valid in the relationship.\" Leavers drop things cos they're enjoying life. \"Who cares where my keys are? Tin foil - shiny!\" Not a good mixture in a relationship. \"Let's make a collage.\" \"Let's make a list.\" I make lists for a very simple reason. I like to control my life. My view on happiness is it's kind of like that. It goes up and down, it's wavy. The happier you are, the sadder you'll be. It always evens out. And if you're impulsive, you will have days where everything's perfect but you'll have days when everything goes bad and you'll fluctuate a lot like that. I can't handle that, so I keep my wave fairly shallow. \"Oh, that was a nice Kit Kat. Oh, bloody hell.\" And if I try to be impulsive I don't know how it's done and I just ruin days. The last girlfriend I went out with, we were chatting, it was the first time we'd spoken. She said, \"Let's go out on a date. What would you like to do?\" I thought, \"Don't be honest about what you would like to do \"cos it's probably weird. Say something sexy and impulsive.\" I said something so impulsive even I didn't really know I was going to say it until after it had happened. She said, \"Oh, this has been nice, what would you like to do?\" I said, \"Oh, let's go ice-skating.\" Which is easily the shittest sentence I have ever said. The phrase, \"Would you like to go ice skating?\" is on a par with \"Would you like a fire bath?\" Just an experience and a range of temperatures your body does not need to go through. If you go ice-skating, you will fall and hurt yourself and it's your fault. Ice has evolved. It's got slippery for a reason. It doesn't want us on its back. I don't mind falling over, I fall over in life, I like a drink. You trip and you put your hands out and you try and minimise the damage. That doesn't work on ice. On ice, you splay out and you slide for another 50 yards, surrounded by out-of-control teenagers with razor blades on their shoes. That is how you lose three fingers. If you're going to lose fingers, you need an anecdote, cos you'll get asked about it. \"Where did you lose those fingers, was in a war?\" \"No, in an ice rink.\" So I panicked. We went on the date, she'd been before so she went straight through the gate. She was doing loop the loop, plies and triple salchows and all that bollocks. I thought, \"I can't go out in the middle, that is the most dangerous area. \"But what I can do is just move around the edge and then I've got a barrier to hold onto.\" Which, in terms of health and safety, is a 10 out of 10 move. In terms of looking sexy on a first date it's a nought out of 10 move. She was looking over at me trying to look sexy and I'm going... \"You like this, baby?\" \"Daddy moves like your grandmother, that's right.\" She tried everything to get me off the edge. \"Come on, John, what's the worst that could happen?\" I went, \"Three fingers!\" She actually misunderstood. Awkward conversation. Eventually she got me off the edge and the sentence she used, I will guarantee everyone watching this has done something they had no intention of doing because of the following phrase. She went, \"Come on, John, in at the deep end.\" There's something about that phrase that makes you go... \"In at the deep end!\" I think it's just because it's rhythmical. \"Dibby-de-ba-ba.\" And you go, \"Dibby-de-ba-ba!\" As advice, it's terrible. It basically means, \"Why don't you, \"as a non-swimmer, just have a jump in that deep water there?\" You might as well just say, \"Go on, try and kill yourself.\" The advice should be, \"Come on, John, let's walk there together from the shallow end with floats on.\" That doesn't scan. She said, \"In at the deep end\" and I thought, \"Well, that's obviously how you learn to ice-skate or she wouldn't have said it.\" So I flung myself off the edge, instantly slipped... And you really need your brain there to go, \"It's all right, I've got this one, I know exactly what to do.\" What my brain said was... \"It's all right, John, I actually think you can outrun this.\" You can't outrun a fall. No one in the history of mankind has ever run outrun a fall. You just double your options to falling or smashing your face into a wall. I started pumping my legs. Cos there's no friction, they just go like that. You enter a move I call the road runner phase, where the legs are going but the body is still. But it feels like you are winning cos you're not falling any more. \"This is just fine, this. \"I'll just do this for all eternity. We'll get married here.\" Then I started tilting forward and I thought, \"I'm probably not that far from the barrier. \"I can probably still get hold of that.\" I flung my arm out and I got the barrier... You weren't expecting that, were you, world? Then I thought, \"That barrier is actually a little bit squidgier than the last one. \"I don't remember the last one screaming when I grabbed hold of it.\" And I grabbed her. Not an outstretched arm or anything like that, just an innocent breast. And because this is comedy, I imagine you think it was a kind of Hugh Grant romantic comedy style, \"Oh, no, how embarrassing, but slightly arousing. See you at the bottom!\" It was nothing like that, it was just a good, old-fashioned, \"Aagh!\" \"This is mine.\" I really pulled on this thing. Various thoughts go through a man's brain when he's grabbed a breast. First of all, \"Hee-hee-hee.\" There's nothing you can do about that, that's a reflex. Second is usually, \"I should let go of this. \"I don't think she's getting the buzz that we are.\" Not my brain. My brain said, \"Don't let go of that, you'll fall.\" So I carried on pulling on it, right. She was a lovely girl but she wasn't built to carry that kind of load. She hit the deck and I came tumbling after her. On the floor she's already laughing. She thinks, \"If we get together this is going to be hilarious.\" I'm lying next to her absolutely furious. Not only because she'd buckled. \"Put your back into it, love, there's two of us in this.\" It was mainly cos I'd found out that when you grab breasts they don't go... HE MAKES HONKING NOISE Devastating. This has been an absolute honour. Take care. Bye-bye. Mr John Richardson. Ladies and gentlemen, are we ready for the next act? CHEERING Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to ask you to help us welcome another very good friend of mine, a very special guest on the stage tonight, a very funny man indeed, please, give it up for the comedy talents that are Micky Flanagan! Hello, thank you. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Hello. Very nice to be here. So I'm from the East End of London. Let's use the facilities. This is the cockney walk. This is your casual cockney walk, this. This is your standard cockney walk. \"Not a lot going on. Just having a little bit of a walkabout. \"There you go. Having a little walkabout. A little look about.\" Just your casual cockney walk. Then you've got your busy cockney walk. \"Obviously I'm double busy. Double busy! \"Can't hang about. I've got to sign on and get back to work.\" Left school with a bottle opener. Made in the third year. It wasn't a rubbish one. It was good, because the two biggest departments in our schools, woodwork and metalwork. So I made the metal bits in the metalwork department. I went inter-departmental. Went across the corridor. I said to the woodwork teacher, \"Do you mind if I put a wooden handle on my bottle opener, sir?\" He said, \"You're a natural, son. \"Things are going to work out for you.\" We made ashtrays in the second year. Bottle openers in the third year. Prams in the fourth year. But my big thing in the 80s, chasing women. Back in the 80s, I was an international lover and player. I was. I made love to women as far afield as Cardiff, Cornwall. I got a girl to wank me off on the Isle of Wight. A day trip. It was easy to get sex in the 80s. You had to really work for it. Women didn't want to part up too quickly. You had to go to work. If you met a girl and were taking her out on Saturday night, \"Bosh, here we go, a splash of Paco Rabanne.\" Get your jeans out of the cleaners. A nice crease on them. And you took her out for the evening, you treated her. You took her out for a Steak Diane. A few Cinzano Biancos. And if she wanted a prawn cocktail, she got a prawn cocktail. Women went mental for the prawn cocktail in the 80s. You'd see her little face light up. You've sat her down and you've presented her with prawns... ..Lettuce... in a wine glass.... ..Drizzled with the dressing from a thousand islands. \"Not salad cream tonight, Princess.\" \"Tonight, you're special.\" \"You're going to get a dressing that's been gathered from a thousand islands... \"and brought to this steak house in Bethnal Green.\" Now, you want the vagina. This hasn't changed. Men have chased the vagina since time began. The vagina has changed, as we know. It was still a big hairy beast back in the 80s. Big, hairy, militant, Marxist, feminist vagina. It was angry, the vagina, in the 80s. Had a terrible attitude. I mean, the knickers weren't small and it was still busting out the side. Big angry vagina! You started rolling these Marxist knickers down and it would come out, \"Grrr! What are you looking at?\" But you want the vagina. So I got myself a place, kitted it out for love - bedsitter. Quality bedsitter. Not council. And I went and got all the latest gear. I spent about 700 quid, \"Right, let's go.\" Take her back, sit her down on the futon. She's half in bed already. Up there for thinking. Go over to my stereo stacker system. Got a stereo stacker. With a built-in graphic equaliser. That does nothing. I slip into the cassette deck, Now That's What I Call Music... Two. Now, I know Luther Vandross will be on in a minute. When Luther comes on, bosh, I'm in. This frees up the time for me to go off to the kitchenette area. I've got a kitchenette area. It's not a pisshole I'm living in. I've got a kitchenette. I go behind my little bit of curtain. Got to have a little bit of curtain around your kitchen, come on. I change into the uniform of the international player, which we know is the silk, black kimono. Come back out into the main area. I've kept my jeans on. I'm not a monster. I turn round to reveal the dragon. Hold that pose. Come back with a nice chilled bottle of Blue Nun. Oh, she's gone. Now, playing days are over for me anyway. I sorted my life out in the late 80s. Met a very nice girl. Proper middle class. She's been skiing and everything. About four years ago - we were together six years - we were making love, right? Making love. She said, \"I want a baby. I want a baby.\" I said, \"Well, if you come off the pill I'll start leaving it in, right?\" So...started leaving it in. Child came along, was created. My wife, quite a middle-class woman, said, after a few months, \"I'm losing my identity. \"Losing my identity!\" I said, \"Have you finished your cleaning?\" Course I didn't. We've got a cleaner. Everyone's got a cleaner now. Poor people have got cleaners. So...she went back to work, leaving me to bring the child up. So I'm pushing him along the street in his £500 pram, which I resented, initially. Then I got involved in a race in Somerfields. Turns on a tanner. Turns on a tanner. Some idiot in a £200 buggy tried to cut me up?! I said, \"Come on, mate, there's a monkey's worth of pramette coming through here. \"Shouldn't you be in Iceland's with that thing?\" I'm not... I'm not a snob. But we did buy an overpriced house to store the baby in, you know what I mean? In a nice area. Really nice area. My wife went back to work. It's the thing about having children, it is a bit tedious because you get up early with them. You get up about 6:30am. By about 7:30am, you're running out of ideas. So the government say, \"Not too much telly, not too much telly.\" They don't know what they're talking about. He loves a bit of telly. Never once has this little boy turned to me and gone, \"There's nothing on, Dad.\" I put him by the telly, right. He's watching Thomas the Tank Engine. I'm reading about the budget deficit, which is very high, as we know, and you should be more worried about it. He's watching Thomas. I'm reading the paper. He's watching Thomas. I'm reading the paper. Suddenly, I'M watching Thomas. Two years later, I'm a massive fan of Thomas. I've got to know the trains again, haven't I? Their little personalities, you know. You think, \"Oh, Toby's turned up, this'll be a blinder, this will.\" No, cos he's not a proper diesel or a steamy, he's square, he plays up a bit, you know. So you're guaranteed a good episode with Toby. Now, the worst thing about having children - you're thoroughly enjoying an episode of Thomas, the little boy looks up at me and thinks, \"He's enjoying himself a bit. I'm not having that. \"I think I'll go off and top myself.\" So he goes and gets in the oven. Keep me on my toes. And you have to go, \"Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot!\" And you miss the end of Thomas. It ruins the rest of your day. Ruins it. It gnaws away at you. You think, \"How did that end?\" And it's not the sort of show you can just pop down the pub that night and start asking about, you know what I mean? Saying to people, \"I don't suppose you saw Thomas this morning, did you?\" \"They brought the orchestra over, right, to play at the fete, the Sodor fete, \"they've only sent Percy to pick them up, haven't they? \"I don't know what the Fat Controller's thinking about sometimes, I really don't.\" \"We know it's a job for Gordon, don't we? \"Possibly Henry, at a push.\" Ladies and gentlemen, you have been absolutely lovely. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your evening. Thank you. Mr Micky Flanagan! Yes, what a great time we've had tonight. Just to round up, I just want to say one last thing. They say PC has gone a bit too mad in this country. Everyone's a bit too PC. Too PC. Now, I think PC's OK if it means you've got to think before you speak and you respect other people. However, it can go too far. A blackboard is a blackboard. Keep singing Baa Baa Black Sheep. It dawned on me when I watched a programme earlier this year. It was called Finding Dorothy. Anybody see that programme? Basically they were looking for a West End star to play Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. I was hooked on this programme. I watched it until it got to the final ten and I found out that one of them was black. And I was like, \"What? \"To play Dorothy? I don't think so.\" Now, don't get me wrong, folks, there were black people in rural Kansas in 1939. They just weren't allowed on the Yellow Brick Road. Ladies and gentlemen, that about rounds it up for tonight. Please help me thank my first guest, Mr John Richardson! And we finished with Mr Micky Flanagan! You have been a great audience. I have simply been gorgeous. My name is Stephen K Amos. Good night. Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail [email protected]\n"

      " Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your host for tonight, Omid Djalili.  Good evening! Are you well?  You all had a drink?  You all up for a laugh?  And THAT is why the West must be destroyed!  You know, when I travel round the world doing  stand-up comedy, I love languages. And you can pick up  languages by talking to people, just by talking to people.  Which is why I know the words, \"Get off, you're crap!\"  in 12 languages, actually.  SPEAKS UZBEK  Yeah, like the Uzbeks know anything about comedy!  But sometimes, speaking a different language is actually quite helpful.  Like, for example, I love Italian food, but I hate it  when they leave the shells on the prawns.  But if you speak to the Italian waiter in his own language,  he can sort it out. I'll say, \"Si, come stai?  \"Allora. Per favore, e possibile, i gamberoni...  \"Can you take the shells off?\"  Haven't quite mastered it yet.  It also works in Arabic shops as well.  I'll go up to an Arab, I'll say,  \"Habibi...\"  SPEAKS FARSI  \"How much are the detonators? Do you know how much they cost?\"  I hear we have lots of celebrities here tonight, and I have to  say that part of this show is that every now and again, the comedians  can make fun of the celebrities, and make fun of people who have a  higher status than them, people who have a higher status than them.  So moving on, it's great to be here.  And I have to tell you, you can relax!  Biggins! I love Biggins!  But you know, this week is very hard.  I went to Blockbuster DVD. I was looking for Al Gore's  movie on the environment. You know Al Gore's movie on the environment?  And I couldn't find it. I said, \"Excuse me.  \"Do you have An Inconvenient Truth?\"  The guy goes, \"Yeah. You're fat cos you eat too much.\"  But it was a great year for anyone in the Middle East because  before the Arab Spring started, we had the meeting of all meetings.  We had Barack Obama meeting the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak.  What a great introduction that was!  \"Barack, Mubarak. Mubarak, Barack.\"  Three years I was waiting for that.  It's like a Tommy Cooper routine, isn't it?  \"Barack, Mubarak. Mubarak, Barack. Mubarak, Barack. Barack, Mubarak.  \"Mubarak, Barack.  \"How'd you lose your country?\" \"Just like that.\"  Three years! Three years I was waiting for that.  And last year was the year they killed Osama bin Laden.  We all remember where we were when bin Laden was killed.  I remember where I was. I was in a compound in Abbottabad,  pretending to be a woman.  We spent ten years looking for bin Laden.  We scoured 27 countries, looking for bin Laden.  We spent 2 billion, looking for bin Laden.  Where do we find him? In his house!  APPLAUSE  But the Arab Spring went all round the world.  It started in Tunisia, then it went to Egypt and Syria.  Every country in the Middle East was galvanised. Everywhere except Dubai.  Because Dubai is a very interesting country. They're a bit too, umm...  There's too much money there. There were people on the streets,  going, \"What do we want? Democracy! When do we want it?  \"After happy hour!\"  And when you go there, they always give you some kind of...  There's always a guide who goes, \"Omid, you come here.  \"You come to Dubai. We are the Las Vegas of the Middle East.  \"You want girl? We get you girl.  \"You want drink? You can drink. You want to gamble? You can gamble.  \"All day long. Girl, drink, gamble. Gamble, drink, girl.  \"Drink, girl... You want to drink girl? We blend girl, you drink it!\"  \"You want all three?  \"We blend girl, you drink it, we bet how quickly you down it in one!\"  I said, \"Actually, no. I'm not into all of that. I'm quite hungry.\"  \"Ah, what you want, my friend? Anything you want.\"  I said, \"I quite fancy a bacon sandwich.\"  He went, \"Pork?! What do you think we are, infidels?  \"This is a Muslim country!  \"Now kindly drink your woman and leave!\"  HE MOUTHS  APPLAUSE  Applause!  Applause! That means so much to me because, you know...  because... No, I am... because I'm a theatre ponce.  No, I am, deep down. I don't like... I'm very uncomfortable  with all this, I have to say. Look, you're all here. It's one  man in this big thing, trying to make 3,600 people laugh.  I'm very uncomfortable with this. No, it is,  because there's a thin line between being genuinely entertaining  and mental illness.  It is! I've seen the tapes of my...  I used to do Godzilla impressions, you know. What was that?  \"Here's my impression of Godzilla having his toe stepped on.\"  SHRIEKS  That's not comedy. That's neurosis!  \"Here's my impression of Godzilla, having asked for Earl Grey tea,  \"but actually getting a coffee.\"  SHRIEKS  SLURPS  SHRIEKS  That's not comedy. That's cos my father didn't love me!  I'll do one more. \"Here's Godzilla, having voted Liberal Democrat,  \"but realising how much influence Nick Clegg actually has.\"  SHRIEKS  Thank you so much. I love you smiling.  I'll get to you in a minute.  But I like to sing, ladies and gentlemen, you know?  I did... I played Fagin in Oliver.  And some people know that it's very hard for an Iranian to keep a tune.  You know, I talked about this before,  we had a tribute band to S Club 7 in Iran.  And they could never keep the tune. They'd say, \"Come on, guys.\"  # Don't stop, never give up, hold Your head high and reach the top  # The creamiest milk, The lightest bar  # The goodness that's In milky bar. #  We get confused mid-song.  And I'm up there. I'm playing Fagin. I'm going,  # You've got to pick-a-pocket or two  # Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooys  # Ya-di-da-da  # Ya-di-da-da  # Ya-di-da-daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  # Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah-ahhhh  # Papa, can you hear me?  # Papa, can you see me?  # Papa, can you find me in the dark?  # If I were a rich man  # Yaba-deeboo-deeboo-deeboo-deeboo- Deedee-deedee-dum  # All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum  # If I were a wealthy man  # I wouldn't have to work hard  # Yaba-deeboo-deeboo-deeboo-deeboo- Deedee-deedee-dum  # All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum  # If I were a wealthy man  # Sibenya  # Bakabishbakaba. #  I don't care. I don't care.  I don't give a shit! I've lost my mind.  But we have some wonderful... I was joking about the celebrities.  Christopher Biggins is here. I have to say, I'm a big fan of yours.  Christopher Biggins is fantastic. Love this guy!  I really genuinely love him.  I love the fact that you say on your CV that you are \"openly gay\".  I love that because I don't know if...  I've actually never met a closed gay.  Gay friends of mine say you can't say \"closed gay\",  but you can say \"Tory Cabinet minister\".  Antony Worrall Thompson is here. This man...  I have a poster of this guy on my wall.  This guy is absolutely amazing. He's well known for creating  the most unhealthy pudding of all time.  Five Snickers bars, mascarpone sauce, puff pastry, cream.  One slice is 1,200 calories!  The man's a genius.  I mean, look at him! A ginger bloke, who makes pies out of Snickers,  and sometimes walks out of a shop without paying.  This man, I nominate you as King of Scotland!  I love this guy!  James Caan is here. A true legend. I love this man.  From Dragons' Den, ladies and gentlemen. James Caan!  Beautiful man.  It's amazing how you also did the Youth Dragons' Den.  Remember there was a Youth Dragons' Den?  Which is basically just pissing on young people's dreams.  \"I want to sell lemonade on the street!\"  \"Been there, done that. Move on. Who's next?\"  But I will say, ladies and gentlemen,  this kind of stuff, it's always hard to get laughs  because people do get offended and I hate to offend.  It's just a gift I have. It is!  It is, because I was in Wales and I told... I said, \"I love the  \"fact people in Wales, you love your kind of terrorism, don't you?\"  About 100 years ago, they used to put bombs by the sewers,  by the rivers. And whenever English dignitaries would come,  no-one would die, they'd just shower them with sewage.  I said, \"It's great to be in the home of sewer-side bombing.\" OK?  And people got offended because you come here  with your suicide bombing jokes.  I used to do jokes about suicide bombing. I'd say, you know,  \"There are now suicide bomber schools now.  \"I mean, how does that even work?\"  \"Where's your bag?\"  \"Oh, I left it on the bus.\"  \"Well done. House point.\"  But I will say this, ladies and gentlemen,  I will say, all this ethnic stuff that people do, it's had its time.  It's time to move on.  But the Kenyan President is called Mwai Kibaki.  And that is funny shit.  Look it up on Wikipedia.  Kenyan President, Mwai Kibaki.  But the BBC news presenters refuse to call him Wacky Backy  because it's a euphemism for marijuana.  They say, \"Today, the Kenyan President, Um-Way-Kay Bay-Kay...\"  \"..arrived in London with his Foreign Secretary,  \"Mr Huge Spliff...  \"..and his Minister for Interiors, Mr I-Fancy-A-Mars-Bar.  \"And also his wife,  \"Mrs I-Got-De-Munchies, Where-Is-De-Fridge?\"  I love young people, you know.  I was on a long-haul flight once. I was flying a ten-hour flight.  There was a young person sat next to me. I thought,  \"We haven't had a chat. It's two hours in. I might have a quick chat.  \"Hello, do you want to have a quick chat? Might make the time go by quicker.  She went, \"Sure, what do you want to talk about?\"  I said facetiously, \"Why don't we talk about Iran's nuclear weapons programme?\"  And she goes, \"All right, then.\" And she put down her crayon.  She goes, \"Before we do that, can I ask YOU a question?\"  I said, \"Sure.\" \"When a horsey does a poo-poo, it comes out in long tubes,  \"and yet when a sheep does a poo-poo, it comes out in little pellets,  \"and yet when a cow does a poo-poo, it comes out in flat, round pats.  \"Why is that?\"  I said, \"That's actually a very good question. I've got no idea.\"  She goes, \"Well, how do you expect me to talk about  \"Iran's nuclear weapons programme when you don't know shit?\"  OK. We're now going to move on, ladies and gentlemen.  Are you all ready? Are you ready for the first act for tonight?  All the way from Atlanta, Georgia, one of my favourite acts,  please will you welcome Mr Reginald D Hunter?  Thank you very much. I sure appreciate it.  All right, all right. Look at you! Look at you!  Thank you for coming out tonight, and I understand a lot of folks  here tonight, a lot of them are Olympic people here, man.  The Olympic people, ya'll made Britain feel good. Good on you. Good.  Cos I know a lot of British people who don't like shit,  but they love the Olympics. They're like, \"I'm really into it.  \"I can't believe it.\" But you slag off everything! \"I know, I know!\"  I told one of my buddies. I said, \"You're not even nationalistic.  \"It don't even look right on you.\" And he says,  \"I'm not proud to be British, but I'm bloody grateful!\"  By a show of hands, how many people in this room  feel that John Terry is racist?  By another show of hands,  how many people feel that John Terry is NOT racist?  By another show of hands, how many people feel,  based on the evidence provided, that it is inconclusive?  And by a final show of hands, how many people know it doesn't matter  a damn bit of difference whether or not John terry is racist,  cos correct me if I'm wrong, he's a goddamn football player, right?  It doesn't matter whether or not a football player is racist.  That's like being concerned if there were pickpockets at Auschwitz.  It just don't matter.  Man, and I don't even care about football.  I don't care about any of it. I was in America when it broke.  I had e-mails asking me, \"What do you think about John Terry?  \"What do you think about John Terry? What do you make of that?\"  I didn't go looking for John Terry. He came looking for me.  And just, you know, I didn't care.  And I looked at the little FA Zapruder film.  It looks like he probably said something racist to another man  in a field of players who more than likely shout racial  and sexual epithets at each other  to get each other off their game, in a stadium full of racists.  And I know racists are not very popular at the minute,  but we still have to give them somewhere to go.  But, man, I believe that there's nothing in the world,  no problem, that's not solvable within 15 minutes of honest,  specific, considerate conversation.  That's right, because if you accurately identify the problem,  then you halfway solve it. That's right. In the Bible,  God told Adam to name the animals  so that he would have dominion over them.  Or, as my favourite Austrian philosopher,  Schwarzenegger, says, \"If it bleeds, we can kill it.\"  But there's lots of people who ain't into problem solving.  If you go on the internet and they have people, they call them trolls,  and they go around, and what they do is they misframe the issue,  so that you can never solve anything. All they do is misframe stuff.  Like, for instance,  in America, the abortion debate is a misframed issue.  And just, all right, fundamentalist Conservative Christians,  they believe that an embryo in a woman's body is sacred,  and nobody should harm it.  But they don't believe that the same embryo,  once it leave a woman's body, should be exempt from execution  or going off to war and killing other embryos,  as long as they're foreign.  So if we are specific  and stay on topic with this debate, what we're trying to decide between  us is what age is appropriate to start killing human beings.  And if we stay on topic, we should solve it in about a week.  And, like, there's lots of people who try to sound like they're  solving problems, but they ain't.  American politicians, they love using this phrase,  \"We're going to send them a message.  \"We're going to send the terrorists a message.  \"We're going to send the Palestinians a message.  \"We're going to send Wall Street a message.\"  But a message is for somebody you ain't talking to. You don't need a message for somebody  that you are engaging in dialogue with. And, like, the same  American Christians, the extremist ones, they have this phrase that they use.  You can be having a regular, lucid conversation with them, and all of a sudden, you'll hear,  \"It's God's plan.\" And that means, \"I'm done thinking.\"  I went to see that movie The Iron Lady,  and I didn't like it much at first, but I watched it a second  and a third time, and it started growing on me.  And don't get me wrong. Margaret Thatcher, I consider her,  she worked for the other side.  And, you know, her side basically believed that poverty is a choice.  Or as a result of bad planning or just plain laziness.  And while that can be A truth, it is not THE truth.  But by the third time I watched it, I felt myself starting to empathise  with her and starting to like her a little bit and I didn't want to!  It's like being horny for a homeless person,  it don't feel right, it don't feel right!  So I started reading about her  and, you know, saw a couple of documentaries,  and I got know more about her and everything and, you know,  she was an idealist.  She was wrong in a lot of her ideas, but she believed in them.  She wasn't just a jobbing politician  who would say anything for your vote or your money.  I'm at a party one night and fell into a conversation  with a young lady and she is conversationally swift,  and we're having a good time and we talking about gender politics  and I just happened to say,  \"Of all the female icons women are encouraged to reach for  \"almost none of them reach for Thatcher.\"  \"I mean hell, they almost all reach for Madonna  \"before they reach for Thatcher,\"  and she got a little pissy and she said, \"Well, absolutely.\"  \"Madonna broke that glass ceiling  \"that had been oppressing women for decades.\"  \"Madonna showed women they could be sexy, healthy and vital  \"well into their forties and fifties, she showed women that they could  \"and should be smart business people.\"  Some of that's true, but how about this?  Thatcher reached all the way to the top in the most male-dominated  profession in the world and she didn't shake her ass one time.  APPLAUSE  She didn't shake her ass,  she didn't undo her cleavage before she went into a meeting with the boys  and she didn't suck a dick to jump the queue, she was true to game.  So this lady got even more pissy and said, \"Sounds like you love her!\"  I said, \"M-m-maybe I do!\"  \"Sounds like you'd shag her!\"  I said, \"I would, but out of respect.\"  Well, ladies and gentlemen,  I believe I have fulfilled my contractual obligation this evening.  Let's try to do it again sometimes. My name is Reginald D Hunter.  Have a good night.  Reginald D Hunter!  Don't be fooled, he's from Guildford.  Are you ready for the last act, ladies and gentlemen?  AUDIENCE CHEER  I love this man!  Please will you welcome Britain's biggest homosexual,  Mr Julian Clary!  How exciting!  Thank you.  Yes, Britain's biggest homosexual, do you get it?  How we laughed when we thought that one up.  I'm less keen on it now.  Just get myself comfortable.  My face is up here, madam, if you don't mind.  I had a platoon of Ghurkhas marching through here earlier.  I started my career in the circus, I was the human cannon ball,  I used to shoot over the ringmaster's back.  I know what you're thinking. You're distracted, aren't you?  You're thinking, \"What the Dickens is he playing at?\"  \"Reduced to such a cheap gimmick.\"  \"We remember Julian as an inspiration to us.\"  \"There was no-one else like Julian,  \"or as we used to call him, that poof from Channel 4.\"  Well, can I explain, I am still your Julian, ladies and gentleman,  camp comic and renowned homosexual, winner of Celebrity Big Brother.  APPLAUSE  These are the very hands that have been down Coleen Nolan's bra!  Erm, no, the fact is I'm looking for love.  I'm looking for someone to curl up on the sofa with  and watch Deal Or No Deal.  Someone to share a pork chop with on a Friday night,  someone to ejaculate over the TV times with.  I'm just like everyone else in that respect.  OK, I'm going to remove these trousers now.  I think we've had enough, excuse me.  AUDIENCE WHOOP  Thank you. Bear with me.  Honestly, I don't know why I put myself through this.  These stilts cost hundreds of pounds  and they only make me 18 inches taller.  To think, I could have sat on Ronnie Corbett's shoulders for nothing.  It's an age thing. I'm 53 now.  It's rather crept up on me.  A bit like a Catholic priest in a public lavatory.  Here you are, Bertha. Look after these, please.  I don't trust the technical staff in this theatre.  Or as we call them, drug dealers.  If anyone wants some bath salts to go home with, Dave's your man.  My knee pads, which I will be wanting after the show.  Christopher Biggins is coming to visit me in my dressing room.  He's an animal.  That's better. Well, I am worn out before we even start.  Cos I've not been well since I came out of the Big Brother house,  I've had it all down here yesterday.  I've had it all down here today. I can't wait for tomorrow.  So, Hammersmith.  If I can't pull down here then I might as well  get the rug making equipment out.  I'd better explain.  I am coming to terms with the end of a long-term relationship.  Some of you may know my ex-boyfriend Rolf,  some of you may have slept with him.  He's a lovely man, don't get me wrong,  always the first one to reach for the wet wipes.  But I'm straying from the point.  Rolf, you see, what happened, he got a well-paid job  which meant he was working all the hours.  So, you know, I would be bed at six o'clock I the morning,  where he would go off to work,  I would be back in bed gone midnight when he would return.  For the last six months of our relationship,  I don't think he ever saw me, standing up.  I was always in bed,  it must have been like going out with a Pyjama case.  And inevitably, I would stray.  I was left at home unattended all day, and every Wednesday  I'd go down the car wash, and you know what it's like in those places,  five or six swarthy asylum seekers  leaping all over you with their squeegees and their hoses.  I knew it was wrong, you know, I thought,  \"Well, I shouldn't be doing this.\"  \"For one thing, I haven't got a car.\"  And Rolf knew something was up, he came home every Wednesday and said  \"Why are the tips of your fingers all wrinkled, sport?\"  It was Rolf Harris.  I said, \"Well I've been swimming\",  he said \"Well, why do you smell of turtle wax?\"  And there was no explanation for that.  He burst into tears, packed his bags and left.  And we had to terminate our civil partnership.  Very upsetting, you know everything has to be divided down the middle.  I don't know if you've ever tried listening to an Olly Murs CD  once it's been cut in half.  It's a great improvement.  So, there are, I hear, some rather charming people here this evening  and, excuse me, someone's caught my eye.  I'm going to nip down here, please don't touch me or breathe on me.  I am already spoken for, and it's the Olympians I'm looking for.  What's your name?  Geraint.  Geraint. Would you like to come with me, Geraint?  A round of applause, please, for this Olympian here.  Nothing to worry about, Geraint.  You're a kind of cyclist person, are you, Geraint?  Yeah.  You are a cyclist, that's very exciting.  I was at the Olympics myself,  performing in the synchronized rimming event.  So, did you get any golds?  Yeah, I got a second gold medal, yeah.  Gold medal.  APPLAUSE  Perhaps you'll get a bronze this evening.  Well, Hammersmith has talent after all. Is your hair naturally curly?  Yeah.  Yes? Nature can be cruel.  We don't have long, we only have half an hour before my Viagra kicks in.  So I have struck lucky, ladies and gentleman,  I have found the man who is going to slip his finger into my ring.  Thank you very much and good night.  Ladies and gentleman, Mr Julian Clary!  Right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming.  You've been a wonderful audience, so that's it.  Let's give a round of applause for all the acts you've seen tonight,  Mr Julian Clary!  And Reginald D Hunter!  I've been Omid Djalili. Thank you very much. Goodnight!  Subtitles by Red Bee Media \n"

       "'Russell Kane. Hello. How are you doing, Apollo? Can\\'t believe I am back again. Sarah Millican, ladies and gentlemen, don\\'t you love her? This show is watched the world over, so it\\'s great for trying to explain British humour. British people give me cheer... CHEERING Most of us. Who\\'s not from the United Kingdom and Ireland, give me a cheer. CHEERING -Where are you from?-Australia. -Someone from Australia! QUIET CHEERING Now, I\\'m sorry, I haven\\'t even begun yet. You see that lacklustre response? -What\\'s your name, mate?-Nathan. IMITATES: Nathan from Australia, ladies and gentlemen. That\\'s everything you need to know about the British attitude to social mores, right there. I was on stage in New York recently, tiny little club and went, \"Anyone from overseas?\" There was someone from New Zealand. The rest of the room, they went, \"Oh, my God, New Zealand, \"you\\'re most welcome, hooray.\" SINGSONG VOICE: \"Welcome to our club, someone from overseas is in the room, \"the energy is increased.\" Right? I come on, asking if there\\'s anyone from overseas. This gentleman goes, \"I\\'m from Australia.\" Most of the people in this room went, \"Go on, Russ, smash his head in.\" That\\'s British humour. The point is this... The stereotype of us and Australia... Any Americans in? Give me a whoop. The stereotype of the Brits is this, we\\'re still really awkward inward, shuffling along with our top hats, unable to express ourselves, sexually repressed, boiling over at any moment. That\\'s true to a certain extent. Most of us spend our lives like that. What we also let out is the other side of being British which is, \"Let\\'s go fricking mental!\" And what\\'s weird about us is there\\'s nothing in-between, yeah? Nearly every other culture in the world has an in-between gear. Not us. Awkward silence or destruction. Go abroad to a non-touristy part of Italy or Spain and experience the shame as you walk through the town square on a Friday night. What do you see? Families having drinks, civilised. Nanas are out, children walking around. \"It\\'s so safe in our town on a Friday night, hooray.\" Couples wobbling. A little bit tipsy but not off their heads. A paradise, ladies and gentlemen. It couldn\\'t be more different from Southend-on-Sea where I\\'m from, where Donna is slashing into a drain while Gary films her and says, \"We\\'ll put your minge on Instagram, babe. No filter. Look at that.\" We don\\'t have a medium. Your Aussie there, he might go out on a Monday. He\\'ll have a few drinks on the Tuesday. Maybe a get-together on Wednesday. I\\'m not going to save up the whole week and then detonate like a social psycho on the Saturday. Why would I? Not us. Look at the face, nothing all week. I don\\'t smile. I\\'ll have a cup of tea on Monday, hot water on Wednesday, no food. A mint leaf on Thursday. It\\'s Saturday! Smash up a bus stop. Back to work on Monday. We\\'re like that sexually as well. Could that be the reason we\\'re so messed up as a culture sexually? We\\'re nothing and lots in that respect as well. You could be a 38-year-old woman, sat in an office, single, shitting yourself. The cats are already licking their lips. \"One day, we\\'ll eat you. \"One day.\" \"Please, I don\\'t want to die alone!\" 38-year-old man sits opposite you. He\\'s your dream man. Graham, childless. He\\'s not damaged from a previous relationship, he just hasn\\'t found lurve yet, ladies. Average female reaction - I will look away. I will not show interest. I would rather die and be shat out into Catsan than show him I\\'m interested. No, thank you. I will not. It\\'s Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... It\\'s Friday! Fingered behind a skip, back to work on Monday. Nothing or lots. It starts early. Have we got any of our brilliant teachers in the room? Give me a cheer. CHEERING I think teachers are amazing. I think this country is amazing, so why have we got the highest teenage pregnancy in Western Europe? Why? I\\'ll tell you why cos we teach sex education at 14 - that\\'s too late. They teach it very young. Scandinavian countries teach it at kindergarten with fuzzy felt. \"Look, my willy is a fuzzy felt, children. \"It goes in the mother, a baby is born, it\\'s logical.\" Right? But we\\'ll not talk about sex. We\\'ll not discuss it. We\\'ll teach it at 14, too late. Those of you with kids will know. Five and six-year-olds, they start asking. \"Where do babies come from?\" That\\'s the age we should be teaching it, don\\'t you think? You can draw a graph with the teenage pregnancy rate and how early sex education is taught in a culture. Therefore, we should be teaching it earlier. Even Nick Clegg came out with this one. He didn\\'t speak it verbally, he\\'s so far embedded in David Cameron\\'s arse, he had to tap it out with his foot. Even Nick Clegg came out with, \"We should teach sex at primary school.\" A woman appeared in the news going, \"It\\'s disgusting. \"Absolutely vile that you could consider teaching sex to \"an eight-year-old girl. She\\'s not thinking about sex. \"Why put the facts of sex into the head of the girl who\\'s not \"thinking about sex?\" Do you know what? She\\'s not thinking about maths or the Tudors either, so let\\'s not teach anyone anything and let\\'s see how far we get. Do you know what else is weird? You can spot British people on holiday. You don\\'t need to hear a football chant or see a newspaper, or tattoo, you look across the pool, British. We move different. We even move slightly tight. Look at the way the Aussie moves, he\\'s loose. He\\'s moving every part of his body, the face is elastic, shaking itself around everywhere. Australian women actually orgasm like this... Wah-wah-wah... Have you never noticed it? I can tell looking in the front row who\\'s English cos you\\'re sat there, \"Don\\'t refer to me, please!\" Posh people actually look at the floor when they lose their temper. \"I won\\'t be spoken to like that. \"I do think Mr Farage has a point about Polish people. \"You\\'ll leave my driveway immediately, thank you very much.\" Working-class people go backwards. \"Do not push me any further, mate. I will go... \"all the way to the floor.\" Shrink. Gesticulating from below the rib cage, how weird is that? Every other culture in the world, move their faces. We don\\'t move this top part of our face. Most of us, if we\\'re posh, we don\\'t move the top part of our face at all. Working class people draw in the top lip, no need for it whatsoever. Yeah? I don\\'t even need my mouth to lose my temper. Could that be the reason - and I think it is - why we\\'re so shit at second languages? Again, you can\\'t blame the teachers. I don\\'t think the people in this room are thick. Most of us just die of crushing embarrassment when we go to say a Spanish or French word. Have you experienced that? You know the word but you can\\'t do it. You can\\'t say \"buenos dias\". You felt like a tit. Right? You\\'re not thick. You\\'re just trained to have a British face. The correct way to say \"buenos dias\", as Spanish speakers will know is not like this, \"Buenos dias.\" It\\'s like this, \"Buenos dias!\" Look at how much of my face I am using. \"Buenos dias. Tiene usted papel higienico por favor?\" \"Do you\\'ve any toilet paper, mate?\" You need that one on holiday. Have you never had the app on the phone? \"I\\'ve got the app. I\\'ve got the phrasebook. \"I\\'m in Spain. I\\'m outside the supermercado. \"I\\'ve got five San Miguels in me. \"Watch and learn, lads. Watch and learn. \"I\\'m so London, I walk like a crab.\" Into the shop... \"I couldn\\'t do it, I felt like a tit.\" Of course you couldn\\'t! Most English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish people, we say hello like this. \"Hello, hello, hello, hello...\" We\\'d speak with horns if we could. HONKING SOUNDS Are there any French people in? I love France. It\\'s one tiny country along and it\\'s everything that we are not. I mean, take any part of French culture. Wine, blank, CHEESE! Cheese. British cheese, yeah. Look at the British cheese. Refrigerated for at least 48 hours. Double wrapped with a sell by date, foil, Clingfilm, foil. You need a breadknife to cut through it. Solid, British cheese, for solid, British people. In the freezer, preferably, wallop! Look at French cheese. \"I\\'ve been out for 48 hours. \"I\\'ve turned into liquid. \"I smell slightly of...\" APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH \"I\\'ve been in so many men tonight. \"My name is Camembert.\" To say I love you in almost any other language sounds amazing. Italian... -What\\'s your name, madam? -Louisa.-That ruins it. I was going to say, \"Ti amo, Louisa.\" If I give an accent it\\'s a bit better. I\\'d like a Sambuca, per favore. But it\\'s \"Ti amo\". Ti amo. How beautiful is that? It\\'s so expressive. Even if you didn\\'t know that meant I love you, it matches my face. An Italian man probably dislocates his jaw if he\\'s enough in love. \"Ti amo. \"I won\\'t rest until my love is accepted.\" Can\\'t be more different to how we declare our love in England. \"If you\\'d like to come to the conservatory please, Carole, \"I\\'ve got something to tell you. Thank you.\" \"I love you. Sorry, I\\'m sorry about that I\\'ve felt that way for some time.\" That\\'s how we have sex as well, Mr Australia. \"Sorry, sorry, sorry, dear. Sorry, dear, sorry. Sorry, if it\\'s inconvenient. \"Sorry if it hurts. Sorry. Daily Telegraph, sorry.\" I know I\\'m making fun of us, I\\'m shining a light on us culturally, but there\\'s something good about that. You\\'re right to be sceptical. There\\'s something good about holding feelings in. We don\\'t need to let everything out. That\\'s what made this country great. We\\'re supposed to be a bit weird, have wonky teeth, wobbly bodies and then die on the dance floor in our 50s - that\\'s what got us this far! We should be careful with Americanising our culture. You poor ladies with all the stuff in your magazines. \"Everyone must have the same breasts. They must look the same. \"Be wild in bed for your man. Are you wild enough? \"You need to be like an American porn star or your man\\'s going to leave. \"Are you like an American porn star? Are you filthy enough? \"Or he\\'s going to leave you.\" What a lot of nonsense! British ladies, nonsense! Your only duty is to say, \"Forgiven!\" after \"Sorry!\" and nothing else! I\\'m not having a go at the USA - I love the place. The Americans, where are you? Any in my sight line? Where are you from? -Florida.-She\\'s from Florida. Again, an awkward atmosphere straight afterwards. She\\'s one of the good ones. She has a passport. She\\'s travelled. Relax. She\\'s not one of the \"Horse shit!\" She\\'s not one of those, is she? \"I didn\\'t mean to hurt her, Papa, \"but she was so purty I got carried away, \"and now she\\'s not breathing none.\" She\\'s not one of those, is she? There\\'s a problem when we try to be as expressive as you guys. And loads of you with sons must be really nervous. These boys growing up watching pornography. I\\'m not going to get on my high horse and be all leftie about pornography. We all watch it a bit, but it\\'s surely got a damaging effect if you\\'re mainlining it into your head when you\\'re 14. You\\'re going it grow up with a very warped perception of what real, English sex is like. It\\'s not like American porn sex. It\\'s not \"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, God, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... \"I\\'m such a dirty girl. Why have I been so naughty?\" No, thanks. Not on this island. How can we manage it in our tiny English houses? \"They\\'ve got foxes next door, \"the dirty bastards. Can you hear that? \"Sort your bins out!\" It\\'s not just the girls. It\\'s us boys as well. Have you seen the state of men lately? Just eating piles of chicken breast, injecting creatine. What\\'s happened to us? This pornography with these weird hulks. I don\\'t want to see some 18st guy, pumping like a sewing machine in a power surge. That doesn\\'t make me feel good about myself. And they talk during sex. Can you think of anything less British, madam, than talking during sex? The American men... \"Do you like that? Huh? \"Do you like that, you dirty girl? \"Do you see what I\\'m doing?\" \"I see what you\\'re doing, Brad.\" \"I bet you do, you dirty girl. Watch what I\\'m doing.\" \"I\\'m watching.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah!\" \"Yeah?\" Having a chat?! No, thanks. Imagine if this English couple went home and tried that. \"Do you see what I\\'m doing to you, Carole? \"Do you see that, do you?\" \"I see what you\\'re doing, Gary. Get on with it. \"We\\'re going to miss the Ocado van at this rate.\" No, thanks. Not here. Not on this island. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for listening. Keep supporting live comedy, keep watching live comedy. I\\'m Russell Kane, thank you very much. Good night. Russell Kane! You\\'ve been an amazing audience. Please show your appreciation for Joe Lycett, Russell Kane'"
