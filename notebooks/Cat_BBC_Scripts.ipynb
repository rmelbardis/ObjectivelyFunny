      "  very strong language. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING APPLAUSE AND CHEERING CONTINUES London! London! London, London. There's only one London in the world except for all the other ones, which is really annoying. Couldn't there just be one? Thank you very much. But we were called Londinium by the Romans and we said, \"No, we're not going to do that. \"We're going to change some of the vowels at the end, because we want the 'ondon' sound.\" And I think that's what we're most attached to. When I think of London, I think of the ondon, the same O-N-O-N bit at the end. And we have no songs. There's no songs. Well, there's one song for London, but we should have a song that... Cos there's American songs. New York, hey! Chicago... And Chicago, hey... San Francisco, eh... And, you know... But we should have one that reflects, I think, London vibrancy and London fuck-off-ness. # London, London Why don't you all fuck off? # But come and spend your money # Come around and spend your money # Have a good time, then fuck off # Then come back on Tuesday # At half past three Cos we need some cash just then # Then fuck off, come back, fuck off # Come back, fuck off, come back... # -CHEERING -I think that's... Ding, ding, ding, ding... Tonight! Tonight I thought I'd talk about everything that's ever happened in the world. And the critics... I said this and critics said, \"No, you're not.\" \"Of course I'm not!\" And they said, \"All right.\" And I said, \"Why the fuck did you say eurgh?\" And they went, \"Cos we're critics.\" So, tonight, tonight we'll talk with the use of Wikipedia, which has taught me so many things that I didn't know and neither did you. Wikipedia has pages on everything! There's almost nothing... There was one thing I looked up and I couldn't find, but I can't remember what it is, so it probably doesn't matter. Everything is in Wikipedia, and you used to have arguments! How do you make spoons, Jim, Jack, Kenny, Rogers? Two people. How do you make them? And if no one knew, you'd go, \"Ah, fuck it.\" And you wouldn't go, \"I'll join a library. \"I'll join a library and I'll get a library card after six months and then I'll look up spoons.\" No, you wouldn't. You'd just... You'd just give up then. But now we've got Wikipedia, we look up spoons. And you'd probably get bored within three lines. If you notice, it goes, \"Spoons were made from...\" Within three lines, you're going, \"Helicopters! Helicopters! \"They took over the world... \"Chickens. Chickens drive helicopters. \"Alligators.\" You know. And you can just keep going until you get to one and you click on it and it says, \"There is no page for this person.\" And you think, \"Why did you put them in blue?\" \"Don't put them in blue and have no page. Just don't put them in blue.\" We have been trained. So, Wikipedia. Yes. On the very sexy computers like the Macintosh computer. I have an Apple Macintosh computer, very sort of touchy, sexy, feely. And you open it up and... In the old days porn would take forever to download. Do you remember that? Friends tell me. Friends who can spell porn. Well, it was... That picture would come up. And you'd go, \"What is it? This is cat porn. \"This is a picture of a cat.\" But nowadays you're just tip-tapping away and a little box comes up. \"Would you like a software update?\" And you go, \"Yeah. \"Yeah, like one of those.\" It's like a latte thing. Yeah, why not? And then time becomes a different thing. Time becomes weird as it downloads. Five minutes to download. Four minutes to download. Three minutes to download. Nine minutes to download. Two minutes to download. Seven hours to download. Six seconds to download. A light-year to download. And then it starts asking you questions like will you sign a new agreement with iTunes? And I've signed many agreements with iTunes. I don't know what they want from me any more. Surely they know I agree with them. I'm just... I'm there, you know? Why do they keep checking like I'm going to go away? No, I no longer agree with you. We all agree. And they've made us liars. You can't say to children, \"Don't lie.\" \"Well, you said you've read the terms and conditions.\" No one has read the terms and conditions, no one in the world! No one. Even the lawyers who wrote it, wrote it like this. It could say anything in there. \"We will take your buttocks and sell them to Chinese.\" \"Yes!\" \"Set fire to your hedges.\" \"Why not?\" \"Put your knee in a sling.\" \"Yeah, gimme.\" Cos you're in go-fever at that point. \"Come on, give me the update.\" Cos it could be that one update, that one update that will make your life complete. You know, like the Willy Wonka golden chocolate thingy with the errgh. Update, yes. And then sex with everyone and free chickens for life. Whether they want to come or not. But then it downloads and you have to do a reboot thing, which is basically getting ready to go to the seaside with a bucket and spade, the engine on, and your dad says, \"Come on, everyone out the car.\" \"What? \"Where we going? Where we going? Where we going?\" Everyone back in the car. \"Back in the car? We just got out.\" -HE IMITATES A CAR REVVING -\"What the fuck was that?\" So, yes, and then you update the whole thing and nothing has changed, which is a bit weird and annoying. If you have a PC computer, I think it's a similar thing. You press the on button and then there's a crank. You have to crank it. And then they get contact and they spin the propeller and you get in. \"Come on, the PC's going.\" Doog, doog, doog, doog, doog. And then you put on a 78 record. Move the horn around. # Wurr, wurr, weeerr... # -Caruso sings the update. -HE IMITATES CARUSO So, I've learnt that the world is 4,500 million years old. If you're very religious, then it's not 4,500 million years old. It's 6,000 years old. One of these is not correct. Using simple logic here. Now the science boys, they got anoraks, they got glasses, they got Bunsen burners and Petri dishes. I've got to go with them because they can bend glass, and if they heat it up, you know... And sodium chloride and potassium permanganate makes potassium pomongadonkey. What was the one that was boom, and all and that and...? And all that stuff that we did. And then if you're religious, the religious boys, they've got a book. And... CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Some really interesting stuff in there, good stories in the book. I mean, I think a lot of the people in there are true. I think it's oral histories. Stuff in there's true and there's slavery in there. Hmmmm. Maybe crime against humanity there in the good, moral book. Maybe it shouldn't be in? Maybe the editor should have put a line through how to sell your daughter? Mmm. Don't you think one of the Popes would have thought, \"We could... \"Could we? You know, we're dumping a lot of these books. \"Couldn't we just cross out the slavery bit and pretend it never happened?\" They left it in till now. It's still there! It makes me think there isn't a God, you know. Cos I used to be an agnostic and now I'm an atheist. I'm all for spirituality and I think there's a lot of religious people who've got a certain something. And I believe in us. I don't believe in God, I believe in us human beings. But if God was there... Thank you, one person. If God was there, I think the first line of the Bible should be, \"It's round.\" \"Looks flat, but it's round. \"Yeah, it spins. It's like a big football.\" \"Oh, it's very complicated. \"Imagine you're an ant on a football and you're spinning, but you can't feel it. \"Shit, shit, shit. \"Sorry about the slavery. \"Couldn't get the staff. \"They seemed to like it. \"Shit. All right, forget this bit. Right. \"Ooh, in the beginning was the Word.\" Don't you think? If there was a God, don't you think he would have flicked Hitler's head off? Don't you think? You know. \"Oh, I'm not allowed to do anything.\" Well, fuck off then. If you're not allowed to do anything then what's the use? Just piss off and stop asking us to mumble things on Sundays. \"Please, could you possibly mumble positive things towards me \"on a Sunday in the coldest buildings you can find?\" \"Please, get some of your senior citizens to wear cakes on their heads. \"And to mumble ridiculously positive things about me.\" So, yes, 4,500 million years ago I do believe our Earth started with a 'place your bets' type of spinning thing. And then we turn up, human beings, five million years ago. Why the big pause? Cos it is a big one. Have you noticed? 4,500 million years minus five million years is 4,495 million years of nothing! Well, there was stuff. There was bleh and bloo...eurgh. I thought dinosaurs ruled the world all that period, but no. They were around for 200 million years. So, we've been five, they've been 200, and they weren't even ruling. Because if they were ruling, on the Steven Spielberg movies, we'd see that dinosaurs were going, \"Rargh! \"Rargh, rargh, rargh, you can go away. -\"You can stay. And you, I like you. -HE GROWLS -HE GROWLS -\"And you, I can smell. -\"You smell of sandwiches. -HE GROWLS -HE GROWLS -\"You can come, cos I... Rumpy-pumpy. \"And let's eat him.\" That would be dinosaurs ruling the Earth, but I noticed in the films that they seem to just get up in the morning and go, \"Rargh!\" With a look of not bright as a button, you know. A few sandwiches short of a picnic. And they just go around eating and pooing each other all day for 200 million years! Come on, that's not a god making that. If God did that, his children would be crazy. And I think if he did exist, he had many children. I think Jesus proves this. Jesus must be the seventh son of God. A-sus, B-sus, C-sus, D-sus, E-sus, F-sus, G-sus. -That's just logic. -APPLAUSE That's just mathematical. And T-sus would always be fucking about. P-sus does deliveries. C-sus started the Roman Empire, C-sus. F-sus, city in Turkey. B-sus was covered in something. Some people applauding there, other people going, \"What?\" B-sus was covered in bees. But, yeah. Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, just wandering around. No dinosaur poetry. Not clever. They weren't going, \"I wandered lonely as a cloud over hill \"blah blah. And I saw a small... \"And ate him. \"And then I ate... And then I pooed him out. \"And that was nice. What a day.\" They didn't go to church. No dinosaur churches. Very few dinosaur vicars going, \"Welcome, eurgh eurgh. \"Thank you very much.\" \"Hello. Hey.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Welcome to today's service. \"We will now sing hymn 409, All Things Bright And Beautiful.\" # All things bright and beautiful # All creatures great and small Rargh! # All things wise and wonderful # They don't live on the planet at the moment. # That scene did not happen. Yeah, so, not clever. I think most of the dinosaurs were not clever from what I can tell. The raptors do seem quite clever. Smaller, about our size. They seem to be able to break into rooms. Work locks, do computer stuff, download raptor porn. Ah! And then run away and not pay. Wooh! They could almost pass for us. You put a little porkpie hat on a raptor, and it almost looks like a human being. \"Is this your car, sir?\" \"No.\" \"Do you realise how fast you were going?\" \"Ha ha. I was very busy.\" \"You were going a million miles an hour.\" \"Oh, really? Is that over the...over the thing?\" \"Yes. The limit is 30 miles an hour.\" \"Oh? That's... I was very busy.\" \"Well, can you show me your documents?\" \"Erm... Argh, huhuh! Good afternoon. I can't... Argh!\" \"It's a raptor! Get me a dustbin lid.\" Boom! \"It fucking raptor. Run! \"Run! No, stay. Chase him. Something.\" \"Eurgh.\" The raptors. And then we turn up. The human beings of this world, we turn up 5 million years ago and that, I think, is the point where we started to walk erect. And I think it must have been a gradual period. I don't think we could have just gone whoosh. \"Oh, this is better. \"I don't know why we didn't do this a long time ago. \"Steve, Jeffrey. Come on, try this.\" \"I can see clearly now. \"The rain has gone. \"I can see all lobsters in my way.\" It really gets interesting around tool time. Tool time is the Stone Age. That's when it kicks off. The Stone Age. Before the Stone Age, no stones, no tools. Hunting was bizarre. \"Come on, there's a bison!\" \"Come on, lads!\" \"Will you die, sir?\" \"Die, I tell you. You're in our territory. \"I peed and pooed all round here. \"I marked my territory quite clearly.\" \"Will... Ow! Will you die, sir? Could you possibly? \"You could feed a family for nine years.\" \"Don't you look at me with those big eyes. Those big cow eyes.\" \"This could take hours.\" \"Buggering hell. \"Come on, where are you? How can you be late? \"It's the Stone Age. There's nothing to be late in the Stone Age for. \"Bastards.\" Boom! Thud. \"Oh. That is much better!\" \"Did you see that? Did you see that?\" The others come running up. \"I picked up a stone. I hit the bison. \"He's just... He's gone. He's dead.\" \"This is brilliant, Jeff. \"This could be the beginning of an age.\" \"Well, that's what I was thinking. \"Provisionally I entitled it The Age Of Big Things Falling Over \"Cos They're Hit By Small Things Of A Much Denser Material.\" \"No, just Stone Age.\" \"Stone Age, yes! \"You were always better than me at that, weren't you? \"Weren't you, Siegfried?\" We're not sure of the names. Language was developed 100,000 years ago. Before that, no language. Before that also, no religion. You can't have religion by grunting. It just... You can't get moral ideas out by going, \"Eurgh. \"Weh. Argh.\" \"Ha ha! I suppose so.\" \"Eurgh, aboo, waa, ooh.\" \"Ha ha, I don't know what you're...\" While we're here, we may as well do civilisation. Just be civil to one another. Cos we got the killer thing in. And assassins, they took drugs. Maybe as a reward or maybe to make them just jump over the idea of going out and killing people. And it was hashish. That's where the word comes from. They were hash-assins. No, it's true. It sounds silly. They were hash-assins. Read it, it's on Wikipedia. You can look it up on your iPhones while I'm talking to you. It's true, I've done it. It's there and they would give them hashish and say, \"You are hash-assins now. \"Help yourself to hashish and then we'll go do hash-assinations.\" \"He's off his rocker, isn't he?\" Cos I do think that hashish is one of the worst... It's the wrong drug to give to people who are going to go out and do something. Unless you say, \"We're going to take over a Mars bar factory,\" then... \"Yeah! Come on.\" There was an empowerment there. \"We're all going to go and dive into bags of sugar.\" \"Yes! Yes, of course!\" But apart from that, organised hash-assinations is just crazy. You get there. \"What? What? \"Hold this, hold this. Get behind the hedge. \"Get behind the...\" Bing-bong. \"He's not... Oh, he is here.\" \"Er, I'm sorry about this. We just... We're hash-assins. No, we're hash-assins. Er... We've got to kill you. We're supposed to kill you. Do you have a KitKat?\" \"If you've got a KitKat, that's like a get out of jail free card.\" \"You have? He's got... \"Have you got three? \"Oh, you've got four? He's got a four-bar one. \"Come on, all right. \"Shh! Schtumm. Close the door. Fuck off.\" \"We should do this everywhere. \"Get KitKats.\" Ding-dong. \"Got KitKats? \"Or just a KatKit? \"Like a Meccano cat...\" Ah, forget it. Then the guy gets on the roof with a briefcase. \"I am in position...\" \"Shush!\" \"Sorry. I am in position on the roof with a briefcase. \"All right, all right. Yeah. \"I will assemble it.\" HE CLICKS AND WHOOSHES \"What the fuck is that?\" \"Attach part A to part B then to part C...\" \"Apply transfers to model aircraft.\" These are the wrong instructions. HE WHOOSHES AND CLICKS HE IMITATES A MOTOR MOTOR SLOWS AND STOPS What? Yeah, no, I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I haven't... I haven't got a gun. I have got a vacuum cleaner. Yeah. Well, it's in a similar briefcase. It just looks... I know, I know. I know what you said. I know. Don't bring the vacuum cleaner. But it's a Dyson Slimline. It's really lightweight. It's orange. The ball type. Goes around corners really well. All right, all right, I'll pack up here. Shall I Hoover up before I go? All right. All right. I know, I know. Look, I'll throw it at him. How's about I throw it at him? No, it's not very accurate, but it has a fantastic element of surprise. And we now, I think, in modern days, maybe we have more of a sense, more of an empathy with people. We can see horrors going on. We saw the tsunami. We saw the thing in Mumbai. We've seen films. Maybe it's not visceral, but you can... You get a very good visual sense of what has gone on in the past. Back in the Battle of Hastings time, you didn't have a clue what happened in the battle. You were either in that battle, or you just fucking forget it. Or you watch a tapestry. The Bayeux Tapestry tells you in panels what's going on, but... It's weavers, weavers were the war correspondents. Weavers were the photo-journalists of the day, going, \"Come on! Come on!\" \"Oh, my God. Look at that. Get that down, Kelly. Put that here. \"What are they doing? \"Oh, God. Keep moving. Keep moving. \"Don't look at the weavers. Just move on.\" \"Do some weird haircuts for the boys, all right? \"Give 'em a bit of a laugh, eh?\" \"Willie! Big Willie! Give him a wave. \"Hey, Big Willie. Good luck.\" \"That's the Duke of Normandy, the bastard.\" \"Come on, win, you bastards. Shoot someone in the eye. \"We've already done that panel.\" \"I've sewn this to my leg. Is that a problem?\" So we were hunter-gatherers. We hunted and gathered. I would have elected to be, I would have chosen to be a hunter. It seems more fun. It seems more dangerous and more eurgh! You put face paint on your thing. It's make-up. It's almost me, Action Transvestite. That's what hunter-gatherers were. We see it with the Native Americans. We're there. We all looked pretty good. That was the one upside of the Stone Age period. We looked fucking fantastic, man. \"Come on, let's go hunting just in underwear. Come on! \"Janine, Stavros, Kenny, Rogers!\" Two people. \"Come on.\" \"We look brilliant. In fact, hold me over a pond, will you? \"I want to see what I look like.\" The only way you could look at yourself in the old days. Everyone looked a little bit hangy-downy. \"I look a bit hangy-downy.\" So that was it. 10,000 years ago, the ice went away going, \"Bye! Bye! Good luck with civilisation. Invent fridges.\" And off they went. And that is when the hunter-gatherer period moved into the agrarian period. Farming. Farming is a step up in civilisation. More cultivated. Groups and communities can grow. But it's a step down in sexiness. There are no farming films. No \"Farming. Bruce Willis in Farming. Farming III.\" \"He was just a farmer. \"Someone stole his beans.\" \"You fucking stole my beans, MacGruder. \"I'll chase you on my yak.\" Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. \"You'll never catch me. I have a yak, too.\" Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. It's on Top Yak. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. One of the best yaks in the world. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Not exciting films. \"Look, the grass is growing.\" Dun, dun, dun. And that's why farmers keep animals, to make it more rock 'n' roll. More exciting. Most of the animals they keep by choice are noisy animals. Cows go moo and sheep go baa and dogs go woof and cats go woof and pigs go woof and...horses go hrrr. And donkeys go eeyore. And pigs go onk. No. Woof or crack. No, they don't go crack. Maybe they take crack. I'm not sure. Jury's still out on that one. Eurgh! Ducks, geese, all noisy bastards. They keep no snails. No badgers, no stoats, no weasels, no, er, rabbits. All very quiet. Gazelles make no noise, except for this noise. Phwaong! Because they leap. You couldn't farm gazelles, could you? You'd have to keep them in a bag. \"You want a gazelle, mate?\" \"Yeah, all right.\" That's not a gazelle. That's an eel. Shit. Got the wrong bag. \"Here you go.\" Phwaong! \"Oh, it's gone.\" They have wings, you see. In the early days. You can tell by... Giraffes! Giraffes have no safety noise. They don't have one. Like, chickens have a safety noise, which is cock-a-doodle-doo. Unless you wedge a trumpet on their face. And then it's driddlet, driddlet, duh! And you can train a chicken to do jazz, which I would encourage all farmers to do. Then the farmer's wife would say, \"What the hell is that?\" \"That's my jazz chicken.\" IMITATES A CHICKEN PLAYING A TRUMPET \"But how does he make an embouchure? He has a beak.\" \"I wedged a mango in there.\" \"Oh, you box clever there.\" And he wouldn't actually wake you up, would he? It'd be like a permanent snooze button. \"And now it's 6am and jazz chicken.\" IMITATES A CHICKEN PLAYING A TRUMPET 12 noon and people are going, \"Milk me, motherfucker, milk me! \"Get this milk out of me! \"Someone plug in, for God's sake. \"I've got to rub myself against a tree.\" We don't know how. How did feral cows milk themselves in the old days before farming? There must have been wild cows in the old days. Cows who were crazy. Wild! \"Fuck you, buddy.\" Cows who would drive through the streets in cars. \"Is this your car, sir?\" \"Moo.\" \"Do you realise how fast you were going?\" \"Moo.\" \"Yah!\" \"Is this your friend?\" \"Ha ha, yeah.\" \"Moo.\" -IMITATES POLICE RADIO -\"Er, Sarge, I think there's a raptor and a cow in a car.\" \"Get everything here.\" \"What do you mean everything?\" \"I mean everything!\" As Gary would say. \"Moo.\" \"Do you realise how fast you were going?\" \"Moo.\" \"You were doing three miles an hour.\" \"Moo?\" -ENGINE SPEEDS UP -He's going faster now. But giraffes have no emergency sound. If a giraffe sees a tiger in Africa, it would have alarm and surprise as two of its main emotions. Two of the emotions of the Spanish Inquisition. Fear. Well, fear and surprise. Fear because, \"Oh. it tiger.\" And surprise because it's a tiger and there aren't any in Africa. So what's it doing there? Is it on holiday? Have they come over with pirates? Through the Gulf of Aden? My hometown. So, yeah. And it would turn to its friends and say nothing. It has no brr-brr, cacaw cacaw, fung, dyka. Nothing. It should hire a jazz chicken to sit on its back and go... IMITATES A CHICKEN PLAYING A TRUMPET Or the jazz chicken could go... IMITATES A CHICKEN PLAYING BEE SOUNDS ON A TRUMPET He could do that. And then it'll go, \"There are bees coming!\" \"Not bees.\" It has no way of saying tiger, so... But it can cough. If you look on Wikipedia, they can cough and so that's what they must use, the very British method of pointing out alarming things. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT HE COUGHS \"There's a tiger over there.\" \"Ahem... Tiger. Ahem... Tiger over there. \"There's a fucking great big tiger. -HE COUGHS -\"Tiger at 4 o'clock.\" \"Film.\" \"Two syllables. First syllable. \"Sounds like.\" -HE MUMBLES -\"No, first syllable.\" \"First syllable.\" Tie? Tie? Second syllable, sounds like... Grr. Tie... Grr? Grr? Tie-grr? Ti-ger? Ti-ger. And then they do go. You see them go. Like, \"Get the fuck outta here.\" And where do they go to? Where do they go to? The giraffes who run. Well, they're taller than Africa, that savannah bit. They're so tall, they must hide behind giraffes, that's what I've worked out. One giraffe is here and then the other giraffes just line out. Just saying, \"Stay in line. Back a bit, back a bit.\" Forward, forward a bit. Back a bit. And the giraffe pretends, at this point, he pretends to be the Eiffel Tower. C'est fantastique. C'est tres belle. Oh, Paris bon nuit. C'est si belle. # Boom, fish and chicken... # Sur la plage, quell dommage # Qu'elle sausage. # Tu m'appelles, oui ma mere. The tiger's walking around going, \"Where are we?\" We were in Asia, then Africa, now we're in France. I can't stand this. Give me the iPhone. Noah, he knew about animals. Oh, yes, he did. And he's mentioned in the Bible, which I think are oral histories. I think it did happen. There was a flood, there's flood stories mentioned in the Bible, mentioned outside the Bible. We saw the tsunami, we know they happen. Now, the big point is, did God tell him to make a boat or did Noah just use his Captain Common Sense? Cos a number of us, if we were somewhere where it was raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining and raining, and we had a big pile of wood, some of us might put two and two together and go, \"I'm going to make a bloody boat.\" Others might go, \"I'm going to make a hairdresser's. \"I'm going to build a monkey emporium.\" \"I'm going to build a big set of wooden shoes \"that would fit a giant.\" But he made a boat. He was quite sensible. And what did he put on the boat? His family. What else? Animals. Which animals? Any he could find. Did he put two of every animal in the world on the boat? No! How can I be so sure? Try it. Just try it. It's impossible. And there is such a word as impossible. It is impossible to eat the Himalayas. \"There's no such word as can't.\" Well, try eating the bloody Himalayas. \"Oh, I got full after about two mountains.\" You're not going to get through that. So, he was there and he built this boat. And just trying to get everything on there would be a nightmare. And it had to be everything, from two dung beetles up to two giant squid. All of them. All the fish had to be there because we know they were bad, some of them. Sharks are bad, you know? Very few good sharks. Very few sharks say, \"We've found a child. He was swimming about, having a bad time We were going to eat him, but we thought it is not our way any more. Since the Geneva Convention on sharks, the agreement that sharks made with humans. We took his leg but that is our trade. We call him Stumpy. Or Thumper. I think his name is Kenneth. So, Noah would be there, saying, \"All right, Margaret. Margaret, just stuff them all over the boat. Lash one giant squid to the roof. Just do it. It's raining, Margaret, it doesn't matter. Just put them anywhere. Shove them in cupboards. A giant squid sticking out of the cupboards going, \"There's no towels. \"Is she there? No towels.\" Giant squid diary, day one. Got to the boat. Everything rather damp. Must inform Trip Advisor. Seem to be running out of ink. Met a number of animals, interesting ones. Cat, dog, squirrel, a mouse. I will eat them later. I can't find Horace. Think he's latched to the roof. And the whole two by two thing doesn't work. Two by two animals? All right, here we go. Kids, we're going to get them up two by two. Two tigers, two cats, two dogs, two fish. Two rabbits, two squirrels, two llamas, two blue things, two zebras. \"How many is that?\" \"That? \"So far? Two tigers, Dad.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Oh, no. What happened?\" \"It just seemed to... \"It became a Wendy's all-you-can-eat kind of...\" Do we have a psychotherapist on board? Because I think I need to readjust after that. It wouldn't work. Lions and tigers eat everything. It's like putting students on a boat with a load of cake mix, isn't it? It would just be a munching fest. I've been up close to a lion and they just do that. And after 40 days and 40 nights of rain... Which is 40 days of rain, isn't it? The nights are implicit, for God's sake. It's a month and a bit of rain. Don't drag it out. \"40 lunchtimes and 40 afternoon teas.\" Just padding out the Bible. After that period of time, they'd be there, from the Bible, on the bit of land, saying, \"We're here. \"As the ark makes landfall, what a historic day. \"God's plan has worked. The ark has made it with two of everything.\" \"And here they come, this is Noah and his family first. Trying to get a word in. They're rushing away, they're probably meeting some friends, late for a dinner appointment. And lions and tigers, there they go. Well, they're chasing... Made friends already, I suppose. No one else at the moment, must be packing. Just getting their things together. What a wonderful, glorious day. Here comes a squirrel, just running out, there. \"Mr Squirrel, how did it go?\" \"It was a nightmare, man. \"Don't go there. It was crazy. \"They killed everything. Those stripy bastards, \"they killed everything, man. There's nothing there, man. \"It's all dead, all dead, it's like a ghost ship. \"I escaped, I hid in a colander.\" \"Oh, shit. You gotta write that down in the Bible. It was a bad plan, man, bad plan.\" \"What happened to your wife? She got away. \"Got away in a boat with an owl and a cat.\" \"Did they take anything with them?\" \"Yeah, they took spoons and a helicopter. \"A little toy one and a Gatling gun.\" \"An owl and a pussy-cat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat. \"They took some spoons, a helicopter and a Gatling gun?\" \"Yeah. It's not poetry.\" So, civilisation. That's what we're about. And, while we're here, cos I don't think there's actually a reason why we're here, but while we're here we may as well try and be civilised. It's just a little bit British. Just a little bit getting up in the morning and saying, \"Hello, how are you?\" Walking on. \"Can't stand the man, myself.\" It's a little bit like that. And the Egyptians and the Sumerians, they started it off. They started the ball rolling about 5,000 years ago. They said, \"Come on, irrigation. That's a good thing.\" And the pharaohs were going, \"I'm 12 years old, I could die sometime.\" \"But you're very young, sir.\" \"Yeah, I could die, so I want to die in a pointy thing.\" \"All right, we'll make one. About head height?\" \"A mile high.\" Bloody 12-year-olds. \"Come on, lads. Cut some rock.\" And it was all kind of sandy, and they worshipped Ra. The Sun god, Ra. They had a song. # Ra, hurrah for Ra # He's up there near the stars. # But they're not there, they've gone somewhere else # And he is there, it's up there # It's quite hot, it's hot # It makes all our ground crappy # And that's why we have irrigation # La, la, la, la # Ra, Ra. # I'm not sure what the song was. But it was something in that area. And the worshipping of the Sun god, that is the circle behind Mary's head. Mary and Baby G, you know they've got the circle? And you grew up thinking that meant they were very, very good? Very, very good. Or the Colgate ring of confidence, remember that one? Actually, it means sun worshipping. It was slid in behind Christianity. Christianity, hello. Cos Christians worship Chris, of course. That's what it should be about. Christmas is when we remember Chris. And how he so brilliantly landed on that pagan ritual of being born on the 25th of December. What is it with Christianity? There was all these pagan religions, and then Christianity went... Boof! That seems to fit. Well, it was. And all those people... A lot of churches are built on pagan sites. So, people turn up for their pagan rituals. \"Let's go and worship on the Feast of Bingo. Woah. \"Where the fuck did this come from? \"Ooh! It's not Bingo any more. \"It's Mr Chris.\" \"Oh, let's worship him then, shall we? Whoever's here, we'll worship.\" So, the Egyptians did a number of groovy things. 5,000 years they were there. And they invented a language, a language, written up on there. And it was a nightmare for newsreaders. Here is the news in Egypt. Man with a hat, man with a hat, dog. Dog with a gun, walking, pig, pig, pig coming, man. Duck with a gun, thing, man. There's an eyeball walking along. Chicken with a banjo. Dog, really powerful dog comes along. And the cat got him in an arm lock. Three things, big eye, big eye, fish, cat. It seems the orgy in the zoo continues into its seventh year. That's what I'm guessing. Anyway, here's the weather with Janine. Thank you. It'll be sunny forever. And now, the Greeks. So, the Greeks came in, cos the Egyptians all died in a car crash. And the Greeks, they had democracy. Two Greek words. Demos means people. Ocracy is a kind of inflatable cat, full of helium. Going, \"Vote now, vote now.\" Kind of like Blade Runner, in my mind. So, they had democracy, which is great. And it took off, there. It flowered through the Roman period. 500 years of democracy. -And then it went... -BLOWS RASPBERRY Somewhere around Caesar, the third son of God. And they also, not only had that, they had the Spartans. The Spartans were... The elite fighters of today are based on the Spartans. And the Spartans were just crazy. Get up in the morning. HE YAWNS Kids! Dad! Spears! Aargh! Breakfast. How many did you get? Got eight? I got seven. Just mayhem. Death by numbers. Yeah, the Spartans. The men, of course, were HUH. But the women were also HUH! The children were HUH! And the dogs were woof, and the cats were woof. The slugs were hehhh. And the sheep, shh, silent. The most deadly sheep in the world. They were the only predator sheep the world has ever known. They would wear bandanas, like the kamikaze pilots. With ancient sheep runes on them. They had not a clue what they meant. And they would sneak up on wolves. They would creep up in the dead of night. Shh. They would never make a bleat. The wolves would wake and go, \"Sheep!\" \"What? I'm the wolf who cried sheep!\" And the irony was writ large upon them. And the sheep would be in a stand-off with the wolves. Cos they knew they were more powerful, but the sheep were brave. And the sheep would take a rusty blade and they would say, \"Look at this!\" And they would shear themselves. \"Come on!\" \"I've got my jacket off now. \"You want to come outside?\" And the wolves would go, \"We are outside.\" \"Let's fight, motherfucker.\" And the wolves would go, \"This is not in the book.\" \"Grab their clothes and run.\" As the audience realised where the joke was, the wolves in sheep's clothing would run down the hill. Run into a local market, buy Slurpees, run off and never pay. \"Hey, I thought they were sheep.\" \"They were wolves in sheep's clothing.\" \"I didn't know. New thing to me.\" And it started a whole spate of that, wolves in sheep's clothing, dogs in cats' clothing. Pigs in giraffes' clothing. Which looked odd. And ants in elephants' clothing. Which was the biggest bluff of all. \"Move or we will trample you.\" \"You're the flattest elephants I've ever seen.\" \"We are covert elephants. \"Worked for the national secret people. \"We're taking leaves back to our nests.\" \"Elephants don't have nests.\" \"Shit. \"We will trample you \"with our noses.\" Deezz, said the man. Forget that scene. I like the scene up to there, but I don't know where it goes after that. Suddenly a cow turned up. \"Moo.\" \"You again?\" \"Moo.\" \"Can you give me lift to the shops?\" \"Moo.\" \"Is that a yes or a no?\" \"Moo.\" \"All right, I'm coming with you.\" \"Stop writing on the windows.\" \"I thought you just said moo?\" \"Moo.\" Just moving that mime away. So, Spartans! They fought the battle of Thermopylae. The Battle of Thermopylae, made into a film called On The Good Ship Lollipop. That was the first film about it. It's an anagram - On the Good Ship Lollipop, Battle of Thermopylae. It's exactly the same letters. It's ALMOST exactly the same letters. It was a Shirley Temple film. She was in her Jodie Foster Taxi Driver period. She was trying to do more edgy children's films. But anyway, she wanted... \"I want to make film, one about the Spartans. \"About the Spartans at Thermopylae.\" They said, all right. And it was On the Good Ship Lollipop, and they did that. # On the good ship... # Argh! Shirley! Spartan! # Lollipop... # But they tested it on children in America and the children actually exploded. Shit, they're going! So, they decided to edit all the violence out of the film, and you can't tell. If you watch the film, you can't tell, except if you look at Shirley, when she turns in a certain light, you can just see a little bit of blood coming out of here, down her chin. But the Spartans were crazy. They would oil themselves before battle, so no one could take them alive. I got him! Hang on. These guys, it's like fighting fish over here, Xerxes. Xerxes, put the Scrabble board down, mate. Who invented travel Scrabble? Come on, we're trying to do something here. These blokes... And they were tactically very clever because 300 Spartans against 50,000, 100,000 Persians? No one knows how many Persians. They now think it could have been all the Persians. Persia was empty that day, they believe. If you'd walked into Persia, just empty, except for cats and carpets. People just helping themselves. We're here on the border of Persia and there's just people with carpets... and cats trying to protect them. Give us a carpet. Get away with a carpet. Vote now. The Spartans were clever as well, tactically clever. They got the Persians to attack them in a very narrow place, which was the corridor of a student union party. Get our cake mix out the window! Take the booze, run! Take the Watney's Red Barrel! I didn't have that, no. It was more Tennent's. Cans of lager. Anyway... So, yes, so that was the Spartans. Greeks fought in the phalanx. They would have a whole group of people with 20 foot spears. You couldn't get at them, they had 20 foot spears. Unless one of your group was crazy enough to say, don't worry, I'll lead the way! A-ha! Sacrifice himself on the spear. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! Argh! Oh, God... Ha ha ha! Whoa hoo! Ha! Oh, I can't do that. Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! Shit. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! Argh! Ha ha ha. Eurgh. Hee hee hee hee! Ha ha! Told you. Extra two foot on my spear. God, he's heavy. I'm going to wiggle him off the end. Thunk! Thunk! Oh, crap! They'll think you're signalling! I'm not, I'm just trying to get a dead guy off the end of my spear. They'll probably think he's a pole vaulter having a really weird... Having a real tough day at the office. These gigs are just for me, you realise. Come off my spear! Bastard! Hang on. OK. OK, I can't see anything. I can't see anything. Hang on, hang on... OK. I'm good. Then the Romans came in with a short, pointy sword, turned it sideways and went... Ha ha! Hang on, hang on, hang on! Welcome to the second line of defence. I'm just going to get a sherbet or something. The Romans took over everything, they built aqueducts, viaducts. They could move ducks around faster than anyone ever had. Everyone was confused by this brilliant move that meant that ducks were always in difficult places to get at. You never knew... Where were these ducks coming from? Even the ducks were going, we don't know why we're here. And the Roman's going, I think they're supposed to be on water, really. And the men seemed to rule the empires. In fact, the women ruled the empires with the use of poison. And the men would say, I, Lucius, I will kill Gaius Cassius and I will be Emperor of Rome. And the women would say, good luck, Lucius, have a peach before you go. Thank you, Calpurnia. People of Rome... Now my young, three-year-old idiot duck son will become... Quack, quack, quack! Quack, quack, quack! The Romans did a hell of a lot, man. They did a hell of a lot, very industrious, very good at killing, death by death. Death by killing with big, pointy things. They were good at that, but they did this with a language which we know from school is silly. It's too bloody complicated. It's just got nouns that are masculine, feminine, neuter, bisexual, hermaphrodite and straight transvestite. They have an accusative, a nominative, a vocative, a locative, an ablative, a dative and genitive. Couldn't they have had 19 more? I mean why stop at 27? I mean, it goes on. If somebody says, do you want a beer? You are stuck in the idea of I'm the object, I. The beer's the object. No, I want a beer. Yes, I do. Yes is affirmative. I want affirmative action, but the beer is... You are the object. No, the beer is the object. The beer is coming towards me, that's a motion towards, so dative has got to be in there somewhere. Just mime me an answer. Thumb? Yeah, all right, mate. How did they get the messages out? When Hannibal attacked through Spain, up and over the Alps, how did they get the message out? I mean, because Hannibal actually won a whole bunch of battles and maybe that was because they just couldn't speak to each other quick enough. Messengers running from one battle to another going, Centurion, Centurion! Alarum, alarum miserarum. Minerarium, miserarium. Alarum miserarium. Touten de soldatens, errr... Mourati on the party. Quod the fuck is the... Quod erat demonstrandum? Ich bin messengare. Si, naturellement. Und ich couriere nach here from a long way away mit newsum tres mauvaises de le battle arium, the battalium, the pugnacco of the peoples and the tuti of the mutis on the booties. Quod the fuck are you talking about here? It's difficlarium. Hannibal! Hannibal? Hannibal? Si, Hannibal! Oh, didus knock mentanatem Hannibal? Si, si, Generalissimo Hannibal. Hannibal? C'est tres dangereux! Si. Er kommt, mein Herr. Arriverarm, arrivederci? No. Arriveramus? Is... Veni, vidi, vici! Veni, vidi, vici? Si, veni, vidi, vici. Hannibal. Mit soldates? Si, mit soldates. No, tout seul, bucket and spade on holiday, I think. Naturellement mit soldates, mit total soldates. Multo soldates, infinitata soldates. Infinidate soldates is mathemelaticus totally impossibiliatus. No, ask Pythagoratus. Yes, ist te truthum. Is the veritum. Pi? Danke schoen. Have you tried just not cooking this? C'est pas mal, c'est pas mal, mate. Rhetorical... Gas markum quoi? Gas markum 3.141. Aah! It's a jokum, it's a jokum. He's a funny lad. Ha ha ha! High fives, Pythagoratus. Square of the hypotenuse. Have you finished? No! Because cette fois Hannibal is coming round the mountain when he comes. Is coming round the mountains when he comes. Coming round the mountains? Coming round the mountains? Coming round the mountains when he comes. Singing... An tik tika tika bong, tika pok tika ding, tika ding dang doh, ee tika tika tika taki di bong. Mit pink pyjamas? Kein pink pyjamas. Cette fois er kommt mit elephantein. Elephantein? What the fuck elephantein erat? Elephantein tres dangereux. Elephantein tres mysteriosum. Front part is elephantain and is similaris con ein squirrel. Hey, man, don't take the piss out of me. I'm just here, you know, looking for my wife. Have you seen a boat? Imaginatus maximum squirrel upside downus, back to frontus. Tailum ist nosum. Tailum ist nosum. Back part is elephantein is smilarus con a magnus pigus. Bigus pigus. Bike pump. Attachum mit duct tape. That is elephantein. Das ist elephantein? Run, motherfucker! It's too big, too long. All that takes far too long and Hannibal would overrun them and kill them all and set up a charity. English is good. It's taken off because it's such a simple language at its base level. Hannibal's coming! Hannibal? What with? Soldiers. How many? Tons. What else? Elephants. What are they? Pigs and squirrels. Run! The English have gone, the English have gone. Oh, God, they had such a quick language. You have to have a tea party to work out the Latin stuff. Yes, we got rid of one of our yous. We had two yous, we got rid of one. The whole familiar you. Aren't you my father? And the unfamiliar you. Who the fuck are you guys? So, we got rid of the first one. That was all the thee and the thou one that the Pilgrims used. Wouldst thee, wouldst thou, would thee, thy, thum... Wouldst thou? Thou wilt disagree. Thou wilt have a bad time over the fact that thou didst send us away. Why don't you all just go? Go and hang in the middle of the country. So, yeah. The Romans all died in a chariot crash and then Charles Darwin wrote a famous book in 18...scritty swam swums. And that book was an interesting book because it was called, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, You! And, you know, it just took off like wildfire and it caused an outrage in the monkey kingdom. Monkeys were furious about it. Oh, God, they were flinging poo at electrical fans that had been specially set up for the occasion. Because the shit hits the fan is a saying that is post electricity. Pre electricity it's just... Did you just throw a poo at my fan? What's the point of that? You want me to switch the electricity on? Well, we've only just had it wired up. I don't see what a... Oh, I see, yes, yes. Yes, the shit has certainly hit the fan now. Before electricity all they had was, then the shit will really hit the Archimedes screw. Much slower. So, yes... So, that was it, evolution, evolution. And we have evolution all the way from the beginning up to now, including all of us, the genetics that go through us, the inbreeding, non inbreeding, the Royal family. Well, it's good that the Royal Family... They shouldn't have sex with people. The idea of being commoners... We have an idea of commoners. Commoners is a horrible word. I think it should be real people. That's what the House of Commons should be, the House of Real People. And the commoners, they're the real people, you see? So, the Queen Mother, she was always crazy. She was shot out of a cannon for her funeral, as you know. That was her dying wish, shoot me out of a cannon. It was kind of a Robin Hood thing going on there. Because she was a Scottish lady, oh, yes. She was. You never heard her speak. Do you remember? The last 40 years, you never heard a word, but she was there going, \"Will you shoot me out of a cannon? Come on. \"I'd like to see the Solent one more time before I land on the Isle of Wight. \"Come on, you fucker, \"give us a break.\" Something like that. But the Queen, I just have a problem with monarchy, because obviously in the third millennium hereditary privilege is insane. Yes, I hear your silent yes. Hereditary privilege? How do you explain that to children? Why do some people live in fantastic houses and we give them cash out of our taxes? Because, errr... I don't know, that's a good question, small child. Yes. Well, it is an interesting question. You know, it's got to change. I think Charlie's doing something, you know, he's doing organic farming, he's doing stuff. The charity he does is good. Some of the kids are doing stuff, but Liz and Phil, Liz and Phil haven't done anything. Liz and Phil just sat there. Because they got in at '52 and then immediately the Queen introduced the new... Then in the '60s, the Queen decided to change the way that... And she encouraged people to... And in the '70s, she completely redistributed... And realised she had too much wealth, so she decided to... Then in the '80s they set up a charity to do... And then they encouraged other people to... And in the '90s, they just totally relaxed, and they said, everyone, why don't you... And then in the 2000s they've set a great example by... Stop me at any point. I think she's got 20 years left. She's in there, but she essentially does what she does on the stamps. Do something! Just do something! Open your house up! Give all your houses away! Change something! Do something! Change your hair. Smoke a cigarette. Drive a car. Wave a bit. Fucking wave. Where's the fucking wave? We pay good money, we want some fucking waving. Got cash, got cash, do waves. Don't you think? Anyway, so, evolution. We can see evolution with fish. Fish swim in the sea, they're very thin, they breathe through their necks and they just seem to be... They have very short memories, I believe, fish, and so they seem to just be going, oh, oh, oh, oh... As if someone's just told them, you realise you're fish and you have very short memories. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, I didn't realise. Oh, no. And then the mudskipper is a fish that walks along on its legs. You can see the evolution with the mudskipper going along. And if you look right deep into his eyes you can see him going, I'm almost there, I'm almost there. One day I'll have a house and a Ferrari. I'll work on the Stock Exchange and lose loads of money down a toilet. And then fish fly! Fish fly in the sky. They must be up there going, oh! Oh, wow! And then they must stop in trees occasionally and go, oh. And then birds are in trees, they're going, who the fuck are you guys? Oh, no. Oh, oh. We're birds, we eat fish. Oh, crap. Oh. Fly, Freddie, fly! Have you ever seen birds chasing fish in the air? It just looks so... You go, I got to have a drink, that's weird. So, that's the fish side, that's evolution. Then on the creation side, God got the world and he went, boom! There it is, it's blue, don't fuck it up. Can't stand the man. We don't know what that means. It's just funny, but we don't know why. But, no, he didn't do it in one go. Which, I think, why take six days over it? Why not just go, boom! He did it six days with one day for prayer. Why not do two seconds, boomba! Fazoom! And then you've got seven days for prayer. And they could just be up there going, God, you're really great, you're really fantastic. Dear God, we thank you, especially for what you did on Tuesday. That was really... Was it Tuesday? No, never. That's right. You never wake up and you hear, God's given everyone an extra banana. What a wonderful day it is! Extra banana for everyone. Never. Anyway, six days of making the Earth, like he's making a train set for his kids. After a while, small animals will be following going, who are you? I'm God. Why are you taking so long? We've got no food. All right, I'll make you food. Sorry about that. What are you, badgers? Squirrels? Chicken? We eat nuts, man. Have you seen a boat? Haven't made them yet. Well, what am I doing here? Right, badgers. Badgers eat bok choy. No, we don't. Not eating that. It's supposed to be pak choi, anyway. It's called bok choy. Pak choi. Mandarin. Cantonese. Not eating it. All right, sprouting broccoli. Ugh! Holy crap, I see badgers can be choosers. What? What, you've heard too many bok choy, pak choi, sprouting broccoli, badger creationist jokes this week? Oh, yeah, up to here, every other person saying them. Can't... Just wading through them this Christmas. That old chestnut. Didn't the Greeks use that one? Fuck off. All right, Mr Badger, creme brulee you shall eat. Creme brulee? That's hardly brulee, that's singed. All right, that's creme flambee now. Creme brulee, creme flambee, where did you learn French? While you were pissing about making the Earth. I was on Rosetta Stone. We were all sitting around there going, La chaise est sur l'elephant. I don't know what he's talking about. Day one in the giant squid diaries. Nothing, it's a void. Day three, isn't it? Shit, running out of ink. Why, why, why? There's no water yet. Bugger, bugger. All right. Give me another Letts diary, will you? Do you remember those? Every Christmas you get your Letts diary. You fill in just the first six days and then blank. Did everyone do that? Then about June you'd rediscover it and start filling it in again. Then you'd backfill it with lessons. OK, I saw one kid doing that. Anyway, creationism has turned, through the mind of a Sarah Palin, into intelligent design. And I have two problems with intelligent design. One is the intelligence part of it, and the other is the design part of it. Because, you know, there's some things which are wonderful and some things that are horrible, disgusting. Cancer. Intelligent design, or just weird fucking stuff going on? Cholera, all those things. If we were God for half an hour, we would ban poo and pee. Why do we have poo and pee? You say, oh, waste products. Why not just eat food and do stuff? There's no logic to waste products. Just efficient use of energy. Eat it and boom, go do stuff. Poo and pee causes all those... Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. All the poo and peeing diseases, cholera, all that... Out the window, if we were God. And then you'd say, you might need the poo for crops. Well, no, the crops grow because of sunlight. Or because they want to. Remember, you're God. So the appendix, it sits next to your oesophagus your entire life going, any grass? ls that grass, mate? ls that grass? What's that, bok choi? No? Arsehole. What's that, spinach? Well, do you want... Forget it. No, it's horrible. I don't want to touch it. We've got an appendix here, but forget it. Asparagus! That's like grass, isn't it? Big grass? Big grass, mate? Do you want to run it through me and Jimbo? Machine? One careful owner. This is insane. I'm calling Intelligent Design. Intelligent Design? Yeah, it's the appendix. Yes, the appendix. Any news? Well, what the fuck are we doing? Did you put us here on duty to deal with the grass? I mean, it doesn't eat grass. Haven't you noticed? it might be evolution. Yeah, well, it might be, motherfucker. We don't want to be here. We're just sitting here, doing nothing. We want to be somewhere else. Where? Er... We want to be in the back of books. You put an appendix in the back of books. Go on, put it there, and then, we don't want page numbers, we want Roman numerals. Real teeny, tiny ones. And then we want endless lists of rubbish that no-one ever reads. Or, they'd read two or three of them and then go, oh, this is crap. And then they go back. You do that. Otherwise... Otherwise we will explode. Your appendix explodes, just like John Hurt in the film Alien when that thing comes out. And that looks like an appendix with teeth. Your appendix very rarely gets huge and eats the rest of your crew. That's true. But that's it. Cows have four stomachs. Why do they have four stomachs? Why not one stomach? Why don't they do it like us, just eat stuff and then poo or pee? They have four crappy stomachs, or useless stomachs. They eat food, it comes back up, they chew it again, it goes back down. It comes back up. It keeps going up and down. By the fourth stomach, surely it's coming up and they're going... This did not need to come back up. This should have gone the other way. I now understand \"shit-eating grin\". I know what it is. Should be shit-eating grimace. Cows should be in corners of fields going... Never see that. Or they should be in cars going, moo. We like him. Moo. Cow and raptor. Cow, raptor. Moo. Go, cow, go. Moo. Put all the moo in the bag. Got lots of moo. What the fuck is moo? I think it's air. Work on the first draft of this script. So, I think we look for rules to live our lives. And I decided to take all the religions in the world and all the philosophies, because I think religions are philosophies with an extra top coat of mystical things, you know. Stuff for people living in trees. Or clouds. Or trees. If a god lived in a tree that wouldn't work, would it? I am a god. You're living in a tree. You're like a bird, aren't you? Yeah. But... Oh, bugger. What I chose from all the religions and faiths in the world, and I decided to try and live... You know, you want some rule, direction to live your life by. And \"do unto others as you would have others do unto you\" seems to be one thing you can just grab hold of and is really good. And it's not perfect, and you're going to be grumpy at people, or shouting or whatever, but if you try that one, I think it's really good. And you don't need anything else. And then there's the Ten Commandments. Now, that's a lot of commandments. I think humans, we like simplistic. But anyway, Moses, charismatic individual, mentioned in the Bible, mentioned outside the Bible. Grew up as an ancient Egyptian, which means he was an Egyptian who was really old at the age of three. Oh, yes. Come over here, young man. Excited, are we? He would say. And, so, he was actually a Hebrew person who was smuggled in and adopted. And all the Hebrew people were enslaved in Egypt at that time because they were there on holiday and it all went pear-shaped. And Moses grew up and he killed a slave owner and he rushed off and hid and became a shepherd to get out of... being sent... Put on trial, whatever it was. And while he was up on the mountain with his sheep, a bush caught fire. And he said, right, come on, sheep, get out of here. It's looking kind of biblical around here. And the bush said, Moses, Moses, come back here. And he said, hang on, sheep, just wait. What is it? Moses, you must leave this place. I was leaving when you called me back. What the bloody hell do... No, I mean you must leave this place in the short to mid-term future, on a geopolitical basis. For fuck's sake, you're a very complicated bush. We're not used to that round here. So, yes. He ran over to the sheep. It's a slow burn, he said to the sheep. Look, sheep. I got to go. Get out of Dodge City. You lads, you get out of here. Run, you run from here. I have to go and do things. So you run and you find the Spartan sheep. They will train you to be ninjas. They will train you to be kamikaze. That's not really useful. That's a kind of...thing. All right, forget it, it's too complicated. What? Moo. You're mooing, sheep. You must find the Spartan sheep. They will train you to become leaders of sheep. And I'll meet you in the final scene. OK. So he runs off. He goes down to his friends and says, come on, lads, we'll get all the Hebrew people and leave this desert. Let's go to a desert. Yeah, change is as good as a rest. I want to go to Surrey. No, it's a bit rainy there. Let's go to the desert. He says, let's go tonight, under the cover of frogs. So... Cos there were ten plagues that landed on Egypt. And, you know, there's a plague of flies. Plague of locusts. And a plague of frogs was one of the weirdest plagues I've ever heard of. If that came from God, he had lost his marbles. Because a plague of frogs is not a plague, is it? It's just a lot of frogs. It's more frogs than usual. To be a plague, you have to be able to go, the flies, the flies! The locusts, the locusts! And you're never going, the frogs, the frogs! I'm drowning in frogs! Help me, Mama, help me! Pull Jimby out of the fil... Out of the frog pit. The pit of frogs. The frogs have got him. Don't lick their backs. Who came up with a hallucinogenic back of a toad? Was that God on crack cocaine? Look. Beezus, just look at this. Beezus, lick the back of that. Lick that. Lick the back of that toad. Lick the back of that toad. Dad, you've said that for half an hour now. Beezus, you're covered in something. What, Dad? Wow, this is really good toad. This is a good year. What year is this? Nothing 27. Wow, excellent toad year. Toads came up with the line, you lick my back, and I'll lick yours. If he created a frog plague, then he must have been going, all right, Tesus, Beezus, Desus, Elsus, I want another plague. You've had ten, Dad. Well, you've had nine. This'll be the tenth. You had a plague of toads, and a plague of helicopters, a plague of people with weird haircuts, plague of dripping. The dripping, the dripping. But there's no bread. I want another plague. Who are those green lads over there? They're frogs, they're playing canasta, world championship. Who's winning? Frogs are, 2-1. Who are they playing? Other frogs. Put them in a DC-9, I want them down. Great Pharaoh, huge, green monsters are falling from the... Small green monsters, quite small. Just frogs. Ribbet! So they strapped them to their heads and they ran and ran. There's frogs escaping. It's OK. And they go up through... And they went through the Red Sea, cos a giant squid held the water back. Go on, good luck, good luck. Giant squid's diary, day 3,009, helped the frogs. No. Helped the Hebrew people get out of Egypt. Running out of bloody ink again. Got a biro. Helped the Hebrew people to escape under the cover of frogs. Was glad to help. Links with Noah. Saw Mr Squirrel again. It was hell in there, man. We were enslaved. Squirrels were enslaved. For what? I don't know. I'm going to marry a chicken. So then they wandered in the desert for 40 years. And if I was with that group, after 23 years, I would have turned to them and said, what the fuck is going on? 23 years just wandering in the desert. I'll give you 17 more years and that's it. And after 17 years, 30 years, 40 years, and after 40 years, there are obviously people going mad, going crazy. They're going, I'm going to have sex with my foot. I'm going to eat balloons till I explode. I'm going to set fire to my buttocks. I'm going to staple my toes to a tractor. I'm going to fill myself with sand and sell myself to a taxidermist. And Moses said, look, you can't do this. This is insane. You can't. There are rules. There are no rules! All right, I'll get 10. So he runs off and comes back. All right, here they are. Rule one, never piss in a toaster. Never eat barbed wire. Don't call yourself Mr Jimjams. Never scrape your brain with the back of a comb. Don't put your toes in a fire. Never Sellotape your eyelids to your mother's. What? These aren't rules. You just made these up on the way back from the hill. I couldn't find any ones with... Oh, I'll get better ones. Two hours later, he comes back. All right, here we are. Always keep quiet. Run up a tree if you see anyone. Keep your tail clean. Keep your nuts and your make-up in a hole in the tree. This is... These are squirrel rules. \"Hey, man. \"Don't have a go at us. We've got good rules. \"We know what we're doing, man. \"This is my chicken.\" TRUMPET NOISES \"Who are these people? They're not Hebrew squirrels and chickens.\" \"They're with the band.\" So, yes... So then they said to him, \"Look, Moses, we want real rules, rules you can write on rock. \"The three Rs.\" So, he said, \"All right, I'll go get them.\" As the audience work that joke out, he ran away. And he was away for months, two months, long time, must have been, because by the time he returned, they had smelted metal. That's a Discovery Channel programme thing. Smelting metal? \"Oh, he's not coming back. He was probably eaten by bears. \"Let's smelt metal. \"Let's make a cast-iron version of a God.\" And it never works. It's very difficult to make a proper mould and get it all working out. Especially in the desert after 40 years. Pour it out and go, \"There, a golden calf.\" \"Looks like a badger whose head's exploded.\" \"That's a stoat covered in sick.\" \"That's a man who's eaten too many balloons.\" \"Whatever it is, he's called Jimbo, and we're worshipping him. \"We worship thee, oh, Jimbo. Please bring us kazoos on the hour, every hour.\" And then Moses returned. He was furious and he smashed the tablets of stone on the ground and said, \"What are you doing?\" And they all went, \"Doo-doo-doo-doo.\" He said, \"You call those kazoos? \"Cos no-one recognised the sound.\" \"They never do, great Moses. For some reason, that joke always screws up at that point. \"We can't do kazoo sounds.\" \"Don't practise now, they're filming.\" \"The force is with them.\" \"With them?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Look, I've got rules. \"Rock rules. Rules written on rock.\" And he had the Ten Commandments, but you don't need them, because the one - \"Do unto others\" - is a self-policing rule. Thou shalt not kill. Do unto others as you'd have others do unto you. Would you like others to kill you? Probably not. So, don't kill other people. Would you like your stuff being stolen? Probably not. So don't steal other people's. It's self-policing. So, those are the two main ones, and then there's other ones like, Don't put your knitting on the stage, Mrs Worthington. Or something. Never Sellotape your hair to a tractor. These things. And there's one in there that's just completely bonkers. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's ox. What? Was that all the rage? Were people going, \"Oh, my God. Have you seen Steve's ox? Oh.\" \"What? Where?\" \"Don't look now. It's a genius ox. It's the most amazing ox I've ever seen. Oh, it's brilliant. It was on Top Ox. You know Top Gear? Top Ox.\" \"This ox can go 0-50 in under a year. \"It is the most amazingly sleek, built by the Germans, you can hang your washing between his ears, \"he really has the biggest face this side of Christendom. \"This is one motherfucker of an ox.\" Why were people coveting oxes? It isn't thou shalt not steal the ox or eat the ox or set fire to the ox or have sex with the ox. It's just covet the ox. It's just wanting the ox. How do you have an ox market? How do you sell oxes if no-one wants them? Any trade will not work if no-one can covet anything. It must have been weird, people saying, \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's ox.\" \"He's not my neighbour, he lives across the road at number 23. \"I'm off on a technicality.\" I used to say it's, Thou shalt not cover thy neighbour's ox. And that makes more sense, because you can't find your bloody ox. \"Where's my ox? \"I can't bloody find the ox now. \"I was in it. Jim, have you seen my ox? \"I can't bloody see him anywhere. \"Someone's just run off with my ox. \"Where's your duvet? \"You've lost a duvet, I've lost an ox. \"There's an ox and duvet stealer going around. I'm going to tell the local... \"Hang on. Look, here's your duvet. \"It's moving. \"Jimbo? \"You covered up my ox! \"You covered my ox. Thou shalt not cover thy neighbour's ox, and I'm your bloody neighbour! \"You're going to go to hell for this.\" Finally tonight, in 1969, the Americans landed on the moon, and I can prove it. Because the Russians were also trying to get to the moon. Russians had the first satellite in space, the first man in space, the first woman in space, the first orbit in space, first space-walk. A load of firsts in there, very good, well done to them. And they didn't get to the moon first. I'm not sure if it was money or what the reason was, but they were sending an unmanned probe there, so they would have taken photographs. And if the Americans had not gone, they would have said, \"You did not go, we have photographs, we have videotape, it's a book, two syllables. \"Come, scientists of the world, we will show you proof.\" Six times they could have proved it. It was the Russians, they weren't getting on with the Americans at the time. So... A bit like now. So, yes, they did go to the moon, and I had a lot invested in that as a child in Bishop's Stortford, watching. I didn't live there, but I just thought, \"I'll go to Bishop's Stortford. Cos it's such a crazy name.\" Because obviously a bishop did have a stortford...whatever it was. So... Yeah. And when they landed on the moon, that was the time, if there is a God in the universe, he should have come down and said, \"You are the first ones to make it from the blue one to the grey one, well done. \"You win Smarties forever and congratulations. Neil, well done. \"And Buzz... Are you Buzz Lightyear? \"Ah, you boxed clever there. \"Well done. Take off your helmets, relax, welcome. \"Don't take your helmets off, that's a joke. \"Sorry, my humour's a bit dry. \"Been hanging out with the British for a while. \"So, this is the grey one. \"And it's just a top coat. We're going to paint it at some point. I'm thinking pink. \"I'm trying to do a snooker thing? \"Blue one, red one, pink one. Yes, yes. I'm God and I live on the dark side of the moon. \"Along with Darth Vader. BREATHES HEAVILY \"Hello. \"And Pink Floyd. BREATHES HEAVILY \"Hello. \"Who do an excellent group impression of Darth Vader. \"And here we have a young friend, the Raptor. \"Hi.\" \"And the cow.\" \"Moo.\" They just drove here, being chased by these sheep. These are mad sheep, who have been trained by Spartan sheep. We have the squirrel here. \"Hey, man. Don't come here. \"There's crazy fuckers here. That Raptor's insane, man. \"He's going to kill everyone.\" -\"Then, there's Chicken.\" -TRUMPET \"And Mr Gerald, the giant squid.\" \"Giant squid's diary, Day 3009. \"We're here on the moon with the human beings, they've made it to the moon. \"They've probably got 100 more years before they blow themselves up. \"Can they do it? Can they be civilised enough? \"It's up to them. They have to think out of the box. \"Good night.\" Good night. Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail [email protected]\n"

      " Welcome to BBC Asian Network's Big Comedy Night. CHEERING Please put your hands together for your host, Tommy Sandhu. CHEERING That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, welcome, welcome. Welcome! Yes! Yes, welcome along to Asian Network's Big Comedy Night. CHEERING We are in for a treat tonight. Thank you very much for joining me. My name's Tommy Sandhu, from the Breakfast Show on the BBC Asian Network. And thank you for tuning into the Breakfast Show, and all the shows on the Asian Network because you lot have now made the Asian Network the number one Asian station in the whole of the UK! CHEERING Number one! Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome to your next act this evening. He's a lovable guy. He's been doing great things since he started comedy in 2010. Since then I saw him at Edinburgh Fringe Festival last year. He absolutely tore it up. He's absolutely adorable and lovable and very smart-looking tonight. Give it up for Tez Ilyas. CHEERING ENTRANCE \n",
      "MUSIC: \"Dil Dil Pakistan\" by Vital Signs Good evening, London. Are you well? CHEERING Oh, you sound delicious. This is nice, isn't it? Hi! This is beautiful. Look at you all. Huh, Dil Dil Pakistan, eh? Eh?! Guess where I'm from. Eh? Lancashire. LAUGHTER I love my mum, right. I'm sure we all love our mums, right? But it feels like we're constantly arguing about stuff. We never get on. Right, like, for the past couple of years, right, she's been trying to convince me to get an arranged marriage. Trying to convince me to get an arranged marriage. Me. And I'm the one, then, who has to explain to her that... \"Mum, how can you ask me to get an arranged marriage \"when you're the one who has been telling me growing up, \"'Don't speak to strangers.' How is that going to work?!\" It's not going to work, is it? Oh, she was really strict about my grades growing up. I'm sure people in here are probably familiar with that. Like, irrationally strict. Like, I remember once I got a letter posted home, right, from school. And she's opened it, even though it's got my name on it. That's the sort of... sort of person she is, right? And she's opened it and she's looking at it and she's found something she doesn't like. Right? And I'm upstairs, right, playing Sega Mega Drive, cos that's how old I am. And she's like... PAKISTANI ACCENT: \"Get down now.\" And I come downstairs like, \"Mum, what's going on? \"Why are you shouting?\" \"What is this? What is this rubbish? B-? \"Why you get B- in this test? I want only As in this house. \"What is this?\" I'm like, \"Mum, let me see that. Let me have a look.\" \"What is this? \"It's my blood test, Mum!\" LAUGHTER \"I can't...\" \"I can't resit this!\" \"No, I want As!\" Irrational. Right, but she's quite smart as well, right? Cos over Christmas we were arguing because we were watching Doctor Who and when the old Doctor turned into the new Doctor, I just let out a bit of a sigh. I was like... And she goes, \"What is your problem?\" And I'm like, \"Mum, it's nothing. It's just that, you know, \"I thought I could be the next Doctor... \"in Doctor Who.\" And she goes, \"What are you talking about?\" And I'm like, \"Listen, Mum, just because... \"like, I'm never going to be the first Asian James Bond. All right? \"That's not going to be me...\" Or any of us. Right? \"But with, you know, Doctor Who, \"I thought I could have been the first... \"the very first Asian Doctor.\" And she's like, \"There's loads of Asian doctors, what the hell are you talking about?!\" Irrational but smart. Some of you have enjoyed that, right? But I've got a bit of a confession. My mum doesn't actually have an accent. I just like to show that I've got range. LAUGHTER These things, right, being Pakistani and being British, sometimes they're hard to reconcile. They don't always complement each other very well. Like, there's different clothes, there's different foods, there's different prejudices even, there's different celebrations. Give me a cheer if you enjoy Christmas. SOME CHEER That's a few of you, more than I thought there'd be. But Christmas is a weird time of year. Cos I love Christmas but I don't really celebrate it, being Pakistani Muslim. It's kind of not really in our zone. But I love that time. And in particular what I really love about Christmas is Santa Claus. I love Father Christmas. Right? I love the idea of this man going around the world giving presents to children who've been good throughout the year. I think that's amazing. I was thinking, like, in Islam, like, we don't have a Santa Claus. Where's our Uncle Eid? Where's our guy? Where's Chacha Christmas?! Where is this guy? And then I gave it too much thought and I figured out why we don't have one in Islam. Cos, guys, if you took... if you took a fat, Asian or Arabic-looking guy, with a beard and some robes, right... There he is. Right? It's just a Muslim guy, isn't it? LAUGHTER Any Muslim guy. And if you take this Muslim guy and you put him in a flying sled, right, with a sack full of \"toys\", led by seven flying animals... camels, one imagines, Miss... and he sets off... He's gone to deliver his Eid presents. How long do you think he's going to last in European or American airspace? LAUGHTER He's not, is he? \"And that is why we don't have Father Christmas in Islam.\" Thanks, Mum - great story. You guys have been genuinely wonderful. If you did like my jokes, or even just my politics... LAUGHTER ..then you can follow me. Um... I'm going to leave in, like, ten minutes, so just... LAUGHTER Can't get this thing to work. There we go. Guys, I've been Tez Ilyas - enjoy the rest of your night! Good night. CHEERING What is up, ladies and gentlemen - how are you feeling tonight? CHEERING Good evening, good evening. Yes, ladies and gentlemen - the poorest Mittal you will ever meet in Europe, right here. But it is such a pleasure to be here, it is such a pleasure to be here. As an Indian who gets to travel often, I worry. I worry because of the racial discrimination and the profiling and of course nobody hates Indians abroad more than other Indians abroad. But I love London. What a great, fantastic place to be in. Because we had the Olympics in 2012 in London - can we have a round of applause for that? CHEERING AND APPLAUSE What a momentous occasion. And like every other momentous occasion, in the UK, you know, they dusted off the Queen... from the shelf and brought her out... on display. I've realised the Queen is kind of like Britain's child. Because the moment there's any major world event, they're like... SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE India, China, Greece... So nice, no? We are paying for her classes. The Indian woman is supposed to be quiet, demure, conservative. Be seen, not heard. Correct? Maybe that's why it takes six metres of cloth to make a sari, which is about four metres more than a burka. And yet we manage to leave this much uncovered. And then this next subject, I want to talk to you guys about, I have realised that saying the words \"sanitary napkins\" in public is like standing in a Hogwarts common room and saying Voldemort. Immediately, everyone is like, \"Gee, what's wrong with her? \"Shameless!\" But you have got to acknowledge what a miracle of technology these things are. There's gel, channels, crystals, wings! Leak lock systems. Ladies, once a month, there is science in your chaddi! LAUGHTER And as you all can tell from my ample Punjabi thighs... ..I hated PE period. PE period was basically physical education and I was the fat kid, chosen for no games. Running with those horrible shorts, thighs chaffing away to heart's glory. And so when I hit puberty, I was like, \"boom!\" Cos what is a dude named Sir possibly going to say when you go up to him and you're like, Sir... He's like, \"Please, go and sit inside class, \"don't come anywhere near me, of course... \"Stand right there.\" Now they have these ads where these chicks are doing gymnastics, climbing a mountain, fighting a tiger! I'm like, \"Don't tell them we can do this!\" My name is Aditi Mittal, thank you so much! I like doing comedy because you get the opportunity to travel around, you get to go to places like Luton... No, I was in India. Anyone been to India? WHOOPS Yeah! Was it like this? \"Hallo!\" But like, with a billion of us, right? But I was in India and the audiences were a complete opposite to the Kiwis. I was doing a bit of my show where I said, \"Who would like \"to come up on stage and learn how to do an impression? \"I need one volunteer to come up on stage \"and I'll teach you how to do an impression. \"I need one man to come up on stage,\" and it was packed like this, right? All the Indian men jumped off their seat, \"I'll do it, yeah, come on! \"Teach me!\" IMITATES SCUFFLES I want to do the Homer Simpson. Please do Homer Simpson. APPLAUSE And that guy absolutely floored me, I was in absolute hysterics because I thought an Indian Homer Simpson... Because he'd freak the hell out of Apu when he goes to the Kwik-E-Mart, wouldn't he? \"Homer Simpson, how can I help you?\" I would like some Duff beer. \"Stop making fun of my voice.\" I'm not making fun of your voice. \"Get out of my shop!\" D'oh! APPLAUSE Very enthusiastic - just like you guys! So that's great. Folks, because we have a time restriction, I'm going to mix up my show a bit. I'm going to do some impressions - do you like impressions? Great, cos there's nothing else happening, I'm going to do some impressions, you've got no choice, really - strap yourselves in! To do that, though, we're going to have to get an assistant. Give a round of applause and bring out our fabulous host. Wonderful guy and a good friend, Mr Tommy Sandhu. CHEERING What was that?! - THAT was my sexy assistant walk. - That was your sexy assistant walk? I was trying to sex up the act a little bit. - Sex up the act a bit? - Yeah, man! That was his impression of sexy... What I have here, folks, is a deck of cards. On each card is a famous name from the movies that I'm going to impersonate. What I'd like you to do, please, sir, is you say the name on the card, I'll do the impression. - You guys ready for this? - AUDIENCE: Yes! - Are you ready for this? - YES! - All right, take it away. - The movie trailer voice man. I love the movie trailer voice man - no-one knows what he looks like, but we all know what sounds like, right? Coming, this summer, Titanic, now in 3-D - hopefully, this time they'll see the iceberg. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ET. I just watched ET again recently and thought ET was really lucky that he arrived when he did the first time, back in the 1980s, because kids were nice then, weren't they? Think about it, right - if ET came back NOW and he met a bunch of kids wearing hoodies... he wouldn't have the same reception, would he? He'd be like, \"ET phone home\". They'd just snatch his phone and stab him, like, \"Ouch, ouch, \"ouch, ouch, ouch! Ouch! Pff!\" Poor ET. (Stay awa-a-a-ay.) Daffy Duck. Listen, Busther, thso, you're the director. Hoo-hoo! If you just take the lisp away and tighten the voice, the whole thing sounds like Richard Dreyfuss from Jaws and I'm telling you, I can't work with this goddamn shark any more, Steven, it's driving me insane. Hm-hm! - Austin Powers. - Very groovy, baby. You're heading for a smacked bottom, yeah! I love Austin Powers, right, but he's a bit over the top, isn't he? Like, you wouldn't want to live with him, would you? You'd be like, Austin, what would you like for breakfast? \"Waffles, baby - yeah!\" IMITATES GUNSHOT Ooh, wounded. Homer Simpson. Hey, everybody - it's Homer Simpson. You guys like beer? Maybe pizza? Maybe burgers? IMITATES PHONE RINGING Hello? \"Hey, Homer - it's Marge, where are you?\" Hey, Marge, you should get down here. It's the Asian Network BBC Comedy Show. It's great. It's so much fun. It's like Apu and his whole family. LAUGHTER Jeff Goldblum. A lot of people come up to me and go, \"Hey, Anil - you look like that Hollywood actor \"from Jurassic Park\". You look like Jeff Goldblum. TOMMY LAUGHS Thanks! I know what they mean, right? I've got the Jeff Goldblum eyes. I'd be more like a LITTLE Jeff Goldblum - well, of course, when I meet new people, I get excited, I get loud, I realise I don't know what I'm talking about, right there, thank you very much... Of course, you might recognise me from the cult horror film I did, The Flea. See, I did that joke in Australia, this guy goes, \"Oh, it's The Fly, mate.\" And I was going... \"I know it's The Fly, because BIG Jeff Goldblum did The Fly. \"I was being LITTLE Jeff Goldblum and I said The Flea, \"because that's a clever joke, right?\" And the guy went, \"Yeah, but it's still The Fly, mate\". - Gandhi. - Gandhi. Whatever happened to Gandhi? Because he made one good film, didn't he? I don't even have an impression, I just like doing that joke. James Stewart. Actually, James Stewart is one of those older actors. He was in a lot of Hitchcock films and Western movies. First, you've got to start with a croaky voice there, first. Then you've got to get the stutter, see? A-And then you've got to get LOUD. And when you raise those eyebrows and show that smile, w-well, everything is going to be all right. And if you slow it down, I did not have sexual relations with that woman... APPLAUSE - Amazing. That's the lot! - Thanks, Tommy! So I can tell you a story - something that happened to me recently. I was doing a gig and I was in the middle of an impression - I was doing my Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek - and this guy in the audience decided to heckle me whilst I was in the middle of an impression, which had never happened to me before and this is what happened. Hey, Shrek - we're going to see the Princess, right? Yeah, we're going to see the Princess. Hey, come on, Shrek - hey, Shrek, you're going the wrong way, man... Oh, Shrek - oh, Shrek, there's a big dragon behind me, Shrek. HONKING LAUGH I believe that children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way... Shrek! And then this guy gets up from the audience, he goes, \"it sounds like all the other black guys!\" Ooh! And 150 people went... Wff! Looked at him, wff! Looked at me, went, \"What are you going to say, funny man?\" And I stood there, frozen on the spot and I thought two things - one, I don't think this guy is going to get out of this comedy club alive. Because he's still got to get past the security guy on the door... MOUTHS: ..who's black. LAUGHTER ..and two, I was deeply offended as an impressionist, because he just said they all sound the same. I decided to stay on stage as Eddie Murphy. And this is what happened next. What was that? I heard what you said. Yeah, I heard what you said. He said all black people sound the same, right? That's what you said. All black people sound the same. Yeah, I heard what you said, man. You said all black people sound the same. That's what you said, man. I heard what you said, yeah. HONKING LAUGH And then Chris Rock jumped up... He was like, I can't believe you just said what you said. If a white dude said that in my neighbourhood, he wouldn't turn up for work the next day - because he'd be DEAD! Then Samuel L Jackson jumped up... What? I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing. Say that again. I dare you. I double-dare you. Then Nelson Mandela jumped out, I did not spend 30 years on Robben Island for this! And then Bill Cosby jumped out at me, you people are swearing far too much. To this man who clearly has no idea what he's talking about. APPLAUSE And the guy got up and he apologised to me and everybody else in the room and I've never seen him at a comedy club ever again. LAUGHTER Folks, you've been absolutely delightful. I've had a great time hanging out with you. Ladies, I just want to say, if you are single, I'm single. If you want to hang out with a guy like me, then I can be any man you want me to be. I've been Anil Desai - guys, you've got a great headline act coming up. Thank you. I was honoured to be headlining this, but then I realised they just decided to put the darkest act on last. APPLAUSE Don't applaud that, it's racist, mate. I don't want to put you under any pressure before I start, but I do have children. And how I treat them is very much determined by how these shows go. LAUGHTER What I'm saying is, if you don't laugh enough, someone is getting a head clap, all right? So just... Maybe the little one, because he looks like his mum. I am married, my wife is white, I'm genuinely Asian, I haven't just browned up for this show. My wife recently said to me, \"Romesh, I thought \"marriage would be more exciting than this.\" It's not, and apparently the reason it's not is because of me - it's my fault. The reason it's my fault is because I'm a vegan. Are there any vegans in? Two of you? The rest of you enjoy life. I am hungry all of the time. I was vegetarian up until about eight months ago. I said to my wife, \"I'm thinking about becoming vegan.\" She said to me, \"You can't become vegan, moron. \"Nobody's going to invite us round for dinner. \"We're going to be so awkward.\" I thought, what better reason... to become a vegan than to not go to people's houses for dinner? I hate it! My wife decided to organise a dinner party for me because she saw me watching Come Dine With Me. Because when I saw her watching the news, I booked her a weekend trip to Syria. I mean, she's not back. And the fact of the matter is, I'm going to be honest with you, vegetarian food is rubbish. That's not just my opinion, that's a fact. I'll tell you why it's a fact - the vegetarian food industry, they admit it. They admit it because they make vegetarian food that looks and tastes like meat. That's the biggest admission going. I've never seen it happening the other way. I've never seen a pork chop masquerading as a nut loaf - it doesn't happen. I don't understand the logic behind it. I don't want to eat meat, but I want my vegetarian food to look and taste as much like meat as possible. Why is that OK? It's like saying I don't like racism, but I find it quite exciting, so sometimes I get my friends to black up and I shout abuse at them. LAUGHTER I sort of came to the realisation that maybe I don't even know if I want to be a vegetarian or a vegan - maybe I just want to think that I'm being vegan. I was at a wedding a while ago. Obviously they do what they normally do - partway through proceedings bring out an Indian buffet. Soak up the booze. Somebody's dancing like a moron, throw a bhaji at them. That's the strategy. So I'm eating this onion bhaji and thinking to myself, \"I can't believe that anyone would want to eat food with animals in it \"when there's wonderful food like this that DOESN'T have animals in it. I said to my mate, \"Aren't these onion bhajis amazing?\" He said, \"Yes, mate, yes, they are. But they're lamb pakoras.\" LAUGHTER And it was at that point that I realised this is what onion bhajis have been missing all this time. Put some lamb in, don't tell anyone. I went out a while ago to watch the football. I'm an Arsenal fan - my problem... CHEERING The rest of you, I don't care what you think, all right? My issue with Arsenal Football Club is how much they charge. It's the most expensive ticket in the Premiership. For the price of a single ticket to go and watch the Arsenal, I could take my whole family to a farm park... Could have lunch and tea. Go on the donkeys. Go on the tractor ride, all for the price of one ticket. And THAT'S why I go and watch the football. Seriously, no way I want to do that! I support Sri Lanka and England in the cricket. I was supporting England up until recently - that was embarrassing. So embarrassing, I've started telling people I'm actually an aborigine. Just to cover it up. As soon as it goes wrong for white people, I jet. I don't need to hang around. I don't know if you saw this, but the Australian cricket fans were so cocky, this is what they did. A group of Australia fans, during one of the tests, smuggled a pig into the ground to release it on to the pitch. This genuinely happened. How ballsy do you have to be to think that... I get nervous taking Maltesers into the cinema. These guys took a PIG into a cricket match! But they gave it the perfect disguise, because they put it in a pram. They put it in a pram disguised as a kid. The reason that's a perfect disguise, think about the number of times you've looked at someone's kid... Just thought, \"What the hell is that?\" A few months ago, I wanted to go and watch England play football. I just wanted to go to the pub and watch them play and I couldn't and the reason I couldn't is because the EDL were marching up and down the country. The connection is not obvious, but what this means is that every single pub has got England flags on it and I don't know why. I don't know what I'm walking into. I don't want to walk into a pub full of racist morons, yeah? Or it could be the EDL. I've got absolutely no idea... I live near Brighton. EDL marched in Brighton. One of the buildings they targeted on their march was Brighton's Royal Pavilion Museum. Because they thought it was a mosque. What the hell do they think when they're stood outside? \"I can't believe Islam are recruiting so many elderly white ladies, \"it's disgusting!\" People are up in arms about it. People complaining on Twitter - this genuinely happened. The EDL were getting tweets that were meant for EDF Energy. LAUGHTER And vice versa, this genuinely happened! \"I'm having problems with my power.\" \"We all are, mate. \"It's the immigrants.\" \"I'm worried about foreigners coming into my home.\" \"Can I suggest that you read your meter yourself?\" You see, I complain about that, but in the winter, one of my favourite pastimes is to pretend to passers-by that I've just arrived in the country. And that I'm seeing snow for the very first time. On a really good day, they take photographs. So anyway, I went out to watch the football with a group of my friends. My friends and I are all in our 30s and we look terrible. We look like terrible tribute acts of us in our 20s. There's a group of guys actually in their 20s looking ripped and amazing wearing tight shirts and that - I hate them. And I think to myself, are they going to make us feel bad, are they gonna make us feel like we're stepping on the turf? The truth is, they ignore us. Of course they do! Why would they care? See a pride of lions hunting gazelle... They're not going to care when a bunch of three-legged hyena rock up, are they? Come to the end of the night, this absolutely gorgeous girl comes out and makes direct eye contact with me - I think, \"Hello! This is happening\". Better phone my wife, tell her I've still got it. The girl walks up to me and does not break eye contact for a second, says to me, no word of a lie, \"Taxi for Rachel?\" LAUGHTER So obviously I had to tell my wife the story up until that point, I'm not an idiot. The truth is, I would never be a taxi driver, because I don't like talking to strangers. I don't mean like NOW, I mean in the street. You know when somebody comes up to you and tries to make friends with you? By saying something obvious and putting \"isn't it?\" at the end? \"It's cold today, isn't it?\" Yeah. Now, go away. I don't want to talk to you, you time burglar. I'm trying to avoid friends I've already got. Not make new ones, moron. This happened to me - I was at a post office. I'm at the post office, an elderly lady in front of me with a cat. I mean, you want to sort this country out, sort that out, right? People taking cats to the post office. Anyway, the lady turns around and says, \"Taking a long time, isn't it?\" Obviously, what she wants me to say is, \"Yeah. Yeah, it is.\" She doesn't want to have a genuine conversation. She doesn't want me to say, well, no. I don't think it IS taking that long a time. But I can understand why your perception of time is different to mine, being you have so little of it left. She doesn't want to hear that. And it's not because people are horrible, people are nice, but life keeps telling me, \"Don't talk to them, Rom.\" I'll give you an example. I was on my way to a concert at the O2 a while ago. I'm not showing off, things are going all right. On the train into London, I'm talking to my mate on the phone, a bit of banter. A little bit of bants. Yeah? No? OK. I said to him, \"How will I know which one is the O2?\" HEARTY LAUGH It's not excellent, I'm just trying to oil the wheels of... FRENCH ACCENT: ..conversation. This woman opposite me on the train, she looked at me and says, \"It looks like a big tent!\" So a) she thought I really didn't know what it looked like. And b) she thought I wouldn't recognise it when I got there, like I might just knock on the door of somebody's house in London. And go, \"Is Dizzee Rascal in here, or what? What's going on?\" But obviously the woman is trying to help me. She's trying to reach out to me. I don't want to be horrible here, so I thought how can I respond to her in a way that makes it look like that was the right thing for her to do? So I turned to her and I said... STRONG ACCENT: ..thank you very much for the information. And then I remembered that she had heard the rest of the conversation. So I just looked like a nutcase. Ladies and gentlemen, that's almost my time. You genuinely have been - I'm not just saying this, either - adequate. So thank you so much... I really mean that. I don't always say that. I leave you with this. I don't like going out with my children - it's not because of my children, I love my children, I think, but the problem is, you have to deal with the fact that when you go out, any father in here will tell you, when you go out with your kids, any other father that's out on his own with his kids immediately assumes that you need to be mates. Right? I was attacked by one of these morons at a soft play centre. I'm just there with my two boys trying to have an innocent afternoon. This idiot spots me from the other side of the centre and comes running over. He goes, \"Hello, there. \"My name's Michael! \"This is Sebastian. Um, we come here on Wednesdays, don't we, Sebby?\" FORCED GIGGLE And I said to him, \"Hello, there. \"My name is Romesh and I found these boys outside.\" I've been Romesh Ranganathan, thank you.
