At the end of the event, I was leaving and she ran up to me, she was like, ‚ÄúI need to know what year you graduated college.‚Äù I was like, ‚Äú1988.‚Äù And she was like, ‚ÄúOh, my gosh. That‚Äôs the year I was born.‚Äù Slap! Right across the face. I didn‚Äôt even know what to say. I was like, ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs the year I was born too.‚Äù She looked at me like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny.‚Äù And then I got in my car and stuffed food in my mouth until I stopped feeling anything.\n",

Recently, my 17-year-old daughter told me that she wants to be an actor, which is so crazy ‚Äôcause when I was that age, that movie Dead Poets Society came out, which is an amazing movie with Robin Williams, where he plays this teacher who inspires these students to seize the day, right? And one of the students wants to be an actor. And, you know, he joins the play and he invites his dad to see the play and after the play, he tells his dad that he wants to be an actor. Dad‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna be an actor, that‚Äôs stupid. Waste of time and money‚Ä¶‚Äù The kid‚Äôs so distraught he kills himself, and then the teacher gets fired and all the kids stand on desks‚Ä¶ Anyway, it‚Äôs a great movie. No, now‚Ä¶ now that I‚Äôm the parent of a teenager, I realized that dad in Dead Poets Society was right. I‚Äôm kidding.
