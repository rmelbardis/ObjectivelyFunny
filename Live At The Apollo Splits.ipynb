LAUGHTER If you\\'re a dickhead or a moron, I think you should be not allowed to have an opinion. -Do you agree with me? AUDIENCE:-Yes! I went on TripAdvisor. Someone gave Stonehenge two stars cos there wasn\\'t a coffee shop! A woman gave Lake Windermere one star cos she\\'d lost her handbag there. That\\'s not the lake\\'s fault! My favourite thing ever, someone had been to see the tomb of Tutankhamen. They wrote underneath, \"It stank. It was like someone had died there.\" LAUGHTER Do you know this, as well? People have been giving their hometown on TripAdvisor five stars to push their house prices up. Did you know this, Hammersmith? Oh, yeah. Someone gave my hometown, Northampton, five stars. Have you been? It\\'s the kind of place, if you wear shoes, people think you\\'re the Secret Millionaire! Now, be fair, when you\\'re on these websites, be fair. Sometimes it\\'s going to piss it down. Sometimes you\\'re going to be in a bad mood. Listen, be fair. I\\'ll give you an example. I got touched inappropriately on a Jack The Ripper walk by a feral mute. LAUGHTER I thought it was part of the tour, I did! \"Jack? Was that you, Jack? Jack?\" Did I slag it off? No, raved about it, five stars, bring a friend. Five stars, four fingers. Er... Don\\'t laugh at that, it\\'s a shit joke, don\\'t laugh at that. Don\\'t, don\\'t laugh at it, it\\'s shit. Has anyone here actually been on a Jack The Ripper walk? -AUDIENCE:-Yes! You\\'re like me. I love \\'em. Soon as I moved down from Manchester, I went on this Jack The Ripper walk. And they take you round the East End, these out-of-work actors and actresses. Hammy? Even people from Hollyoaks were saying, \"Tone it down, love,\" do you know what I\\'m saying? They lie to you, they make out... Is anyone here from the East End? WHOOPING AND WHISTLING They make out, don\\'t they, it\\'s all Dickensian, Victorian, cobbled streets? It\\'s not, it\\'s modern now. I\\'m following this woman round on this Jack The Ripper tour. \"And the prostitute was slashed from ear to ear! \"Left to die on the floor like a dog!\" And you\\'re in the doorway of a Londis! LAUGHTER The electric doors are going zub-zub, zub-zub, zub-zub! I fell out with TripAdvisor big time. I went to Oman for a week. I looked on TripAdvisor. \"Food is to die for.\" \"The people are so friendly.\" \"The sea is crystal clear.\" Didn\\'t say that homosexuality was illegal, did they? I had to be butch for a week. A week! I used muscles in my legs I didn\\'t even know I had. And it\\'s horrible because, at the resort, I could hear people saying things like, \"Oh, here she is.\" \"Bet he\\'s one of those.\" Do you know what I mean? So I kept throwing them off the scent. I kept walking into the foyer, shouting loudly, \"Has my wife arrived yet?\" You can\\'t miss her, she\\'s got a cock! CHEERING I\\'ve been all over this year. I\\'ve been really lucky. My mum had a big birthday last year, so I took her on safari. How nice is that? WHOOPING Took her on safari. My other half wanted to go. It\\'s expensive, though, isn\\'t it? It\\'s expensive. My other half wanted to come. I said, \"No, just watch it on Skype, it\\'ll be like you\\'re there!\" Dressed my mum up in an animal onesie, \"Look how close they are!\" LAUGHTER No, it\\'s funny, me and my mum, we went to Africa, yeah, and we went to the resort, went to the hut, opened the hut door, massive double bed, written in rose petals, \"Alan and Christine.\" LAUGHTER HE RETCHES So we ended up making love. LAUGHTER No, we did not! No, we did not! Well, the ranger knocks on the door and says, \"Do you and your mum want to stalk a rhino?\" No, it\\'s not what you\\'re thinking. \"What are you wearing? I\\'m outside.\" No. It\\'s when you follow a rhino on foot through the bushes and shit, like this, yeah? I didn\\'t know if I wanted to do this with my mum because me and my mum have got beef, right? When I was growing up, I was in the garden and a bee came in the garden and my mum went, \"Alan! Pretend to be a flower!\" LAUGHTER \"And it will buzz away!\" When you think about it, bees love flowers, don\\'t they? That\\'s twisted shit! And I\\'m going on safari with this woman?! \"Look, Alan, there\\'s a lion. Pretend to be a leg of lamb!\" LAUGHTER So I\\'m with the ranger, yeah, and he starts telling us about stalking a rhino. \"Obviously when you approach the beast, if there\\'s any sudden \"movement or noise, just make small, comfortable steps, like this, \"back to the jeep with no sound, like so.\" HE HUMS \"SINGLE LADIES\" LAUGHTER I got all cocky. I went, \"Hello? Of course I\\'m going to do that, I\\'m not a moron! \"Of course I\\'m going to make small, comfortable steps back to the jeep! \"Do you think I\\'m a dickhead?\" LAUGHTER Next day, me and my mum are walking up to this rhino, like this, through the bushes. All of a sudden, it turns around and goes... HE GRUNTS LOUDLY I went... HIGH-PITCHED: \"Aaaaaaargh!\" LAUGHTER I ran! I ran! Not only did I run, I pushed my mum in front of it! I ran in Crocs. That\\'s hard. Cos that ain\\'t my idea of fun, do you know what I\\'m saying? The closest I\\'ve come to death is nearly choking on a Berocca. My idea of brave is to keep my iPod on shuffle at a party. That\\'s brave. LAUGHTER Why does everything have to be extreme? That\\'s what gets me, do you know what I mean? What\\'s on the telly these days? What do we have? Extreme Fishing With Robson Green. What else? Extreme Makeover, what else? -WOMAN IN AUDIENCE:-Couponing! Extreme Couponing! That show is shit, but it\\'s like crack, ain\\'t it? Does anyone watch it? LAUGHTER I know! You go, \"Who watches this shit?\" Cut to four o\\'clock in the morning - \"Will she ever spend those coupons on bleach?\" Extreme Weather. Weather\\'s extreme, isn\\'t it? You know who\\'s loving the extreme weather, don\\'t you? The weather forecasters. They\\'re loving the drama. Who\\'s that one, BBC weather in the morning? Scottish woman? Carol! She\\'s loving it, the extreme weather. She\\'s dishing out advice now, have you seen her? HE IMITATES: \"It\\'s going to rain today, so I\\'d wear a coat.\" Thanks, Carol. What about when they start telling you the weather that\\'s happening at the minute, have you seen that? HE IMITATES: \"It\\'s sunny outside.\" Aw, thanks, Carol, I wondered what that fucking window was for! Innit! What about when they tell you the weather that\\'s happening at night? Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit?! HE IMITATES: \"It\\'s going to rain at one in the morning.\" Who cares?! What, you ever get a load of prostitutes going, \"I\\'ll be packing my waders.\" APPLAUSE I\\'m glad people are discussing extreme weather. Are you? People are saying, \"Look after the elderly, \"get water in, get sandbags, get food.\" Cos, when I was growing up and we had extreme weather, we were just told to go out and play! Remember your mum? \"Go out and play!\" A cow blows past the window! Hail stones, hurricanes, tsunamis, I\\'d be outside. If you didn\\'t come back with a wind chime embedded in your face, you hadn\\'t lived! I know it was bloody cold back then, you look at my school photos. 1984 to 1990, cold sore, pow! Every year, cold sore, pow! Right there in the middle of my big, round, pasty-white face. If I wore a metallic ruff, I\\'d look like a Cherry Bakewell. The thing is, with cold sores, if I had a hump on my back or a hairy mole, no-one would have mentioned it. Cold sores, people start sucking their teeth, pointing, don\\'t they? HE INHALES SHARPLY \"Ooh! \"Is that a cold sore?\" \"No, me bindi slipped! What do you think? \"What do you think?\" Then they start dropping the H-bomb, don\\'t they? \"Ooh, that\\'s herpes.\" Whoa, whoa, whoa! Why are you mentioning...? Why drag it down to that level? You wouldn\\'t go up to someone who\\'s got a chipped nail, \"Why, was you wanking off a tramp? Oh, sorry!\" Sorry, just asking, I just thought I\\'d ask. Does anyone here actually suffer with cold sores? CROWD RESPONDS QUIETLY Woman at the back in a crash helmet, \"Yeah.\" I mean, if you have got skin disorders... Can you listen to this? Hammersmith, will you listen to this, please? My friend... Well, she\\'s not my friend, she\\'s a friend of a friend. She drinks her own urine. AUDIENCE GROANS Listen, her skin is amazing, her skin is to die for. Her breath bloody stinks, but... People throw stones at her in the street and call her a witch. But her skin - mwah! I mean, I\\'m having a laugh about this, but I\\'ve had cold sores all my life. And it gets me down, it gets me depressed. I\\'ve tried everything, lotions, potions, pills, you name it, I\\'ve done whatever to get rid of it. This is how desperate I got. I went to one of those fish pedicure places. And... AUDIENCE MURMURS I distracted the woman, and I bobbed. \"Bite it, bite it!\" It came off, I had a verruca. That would just be my luck, honestly. Athlete\\'s foot. No! I mentioned school photos before. You can\\'t explain to this iPhone generation, can you, about school photos? That was your one photo. You take photos now every minute of the day. That was your one photo. If that school photo was shit, you had a shit year. Right? That photo was good, you had a good year, yeah? It\\'s all right, you with your iPhones now, deleting, rotating, putting your different filters on. Sepia? Why anyone would choose sepia? Why choose sepia? Why do you want to look like you\\'ve got jaundice? Why? \"Here\\'s me at Chessington World Of Adventure. With liver failure.\" School photos, you could not mess it up. You\\'d stand in a line outside the classroom, stand in a line. Psht! \"Next.\" Psht! \"Next.\" Psht! \"Next.\" Psht! \"Next.\" Psht! \"Next.\" 1987, I sneezed. I said, \"Can I take it again?\" \"No. Next.\" \"I can\\'t look like that!\" And every member of your family bought it, didn\\'t it? Every house you\\'d go to, I\\'d be on the mantelpiece... This was the \\'80s. What you looked like was what you looked like. No Photoshopping and all that, airbrushing, shit like that, no. Plastic surgery? No. What you looked like was what you looked like. And I think we all owe it to ourselves to make ourselves look a bit better, don\\'t we? We can all do little bits to make ourselves look better. I\\'m not having a go, girls, I\\'m not. But you know the women who have the hairy face? No. You know the women with the five o\\'clock shadow? You know? They go, \"Well, if I shave it, it\\'ll only come back twice as thick.\" And you\\'re like, \"Well, have a go. \"Don\\'t give up hope just yet. \"You look like an Ewok. Shave.\" LAUGHTER I mentioned iPhones there. And I don\\'t want to drag the night down, cos we\\'ve got some great guests coming on. But my friend who\\'s a teacher, she was telling me that some of the kids in her class have been using their iPhone to take photos of their, um... HE MUMBLES: ..private parts. I don\\'t want to be rude cos it\\'s a BBC Two show. HE MUMBLES: Private parts. Some of the kids have been taking photos of their private parts and sending them on the iPhone to all the kids in the class. I thought, \"Isn\\'t that sad?\" Because, in my day, A, I didn\\'t have the inclination to do that. And, B, I didn\\'t have a camera on my phone. So, if I wanted to show the whole class my knob, I\\'d have to trace it with some Izal toilet paper and stick it on an overhead projector. \"Thank you - my knob.\" APPLAUSE AND CHEERING \"Thank you. \"My knob. \"My knob. Thank you.\" Oh, my God, I\\'m on a loop. My knob. Shit, I can\\'t stop. My knob. HE GIGGLES Well, Hammersmith, I think you\\'ve been warmed up very nicely. Are you in the mood for some top-notch comedy? WHOOPING AND CHEERING Good. Well, please give a wonderful Hammersmith welcome to the fantastic '"

       "'James Acaster. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE \\nMUSIC PLAYS -Yeah. -LAUGHTER Tonight, I want to tell you about a friend of mine. He works in a casino. And one day, he... Is dice plural and die singular? Or is die plural? Anyway, he killed two people by mistake. Say he\\'s my friend. He\\'s not really my friend. I\\'m on the jury. I shouldn\\'t say friend, should I? They make that very clear. \"He\\'s not your friend, mate.\" I see him every day, he seems like a nice guy. There was someone else called James on the jury. Got confusing. How we got round it, right, everyone would call HIM James One and me Wolf. I got to choose my own name. It\\'s pretty cool. Me and James One hit the town, cutting it up. I was making an effort for once, dressed to impress, I had my best tie on. Paisley, paisley makes the girls go crazily. Walking round. Chatting to a lady at one point. She was lovely. Lovely, lovely lady. She\\'s a masseuse, big respect. I\\'ve tried to give a massage to partners in the past. Not easy, is it? Not sexy massage, drag your minds out the gutter, just normal massage. You know, just normal massage you do in a relationship. You know, normal, just normal. Normal stuff. Normally what? You\\'re normally in bed, ain\\'t you, normally, for a massage with your partner? Normally in bed. End of the day, fair to say. End of the day, bed. Don\\'t do a massage in the morning, that\\'s far too decadent. Save it to the end. Lights out, aren\\'t they? Lying down. Completely dark, ain\\'t it? Just lying there and only one of you knows that a massage is about to take place. If you\\'re not in on it, you\\'re sitting there, you\\'ve got your eyes closed and you\\'re thinking to yourself, \"I\\'m going to go to sleep now. I\\'m going to go to sleep. You\\'re lying there, feeling safe. Just me and the person I trust most in the world. The last thing I\\'m expecting at this point is an ambush. And then, the partner will turn to you...in the dark, like a coward, spineless, and they\\'ll say, \"I\\'ve got a genuine muscular complaint... \"that I really should get seen to by a trained professional. \"However...how would you like to improvise a massage on me \"with your zero expertise?\" \"Would I ever? Let\\'s get this light back on.\" Then the masseuse... ..will assume the position. Which, if you\\'ve ever received a massage from a partner before, you\\'ll know the position in question is sitting on them. Again, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever paid for a professional massage... This move rarely crops up. Park themselves on your lower back - it\\'s too familiar. Get your partner to do it, you get what you pay for, you cheapskate. They\\'re sitting on you, just sitting on you! Just sitting on you. You know, like a bully does. Just sitting on you like a bully. And then, they start guessing. Just... ..having a flying guess all over your back, doing moves they\\'ve half-remembered from films they\\'ve seen. If you can\\'t see what I\\'m doing at the back there, I\\'m just using the heels of my hands. You want to put them either side of the spine and then, you want to put your full weight on that in the hope that that\\'s OK. Wing that, chance it - it\\'s not your back. And just move them out in a pattern that, from where you are, looks nice. It\\'s pleasing to your eye if not to their actual back. Nice and symmetrical all the way up. A bit of shoulder work, obviously. You\\'re not stingy, are you? Some shoulder work while you\\'re there. What you\\'re doing there, just gathering all the skin and muscle... A nice chunky pinch and just let it go and do it again. That\\'s all that is. Letting it go, just move it somewhere else, put it back where it was. That\\'s that move. Like an arcade claw that never wins anything, never gets any toys. No toys. No toys. Hardest part of jury duty. LAUGHTER I\\'ll tell you what it is. The debates. We had to go off, just the jury, in a little room and debate the case every day. Everyone else had opinions, except for me. I felt stupid. In the end, I just played devil\\'s advocate. That\\'s what you do if you don\\'t have an opinion. It\\'s clever. Because devil\\'s advocate, you don\\'t need an opinion. You just say the opposite to what everyone else is saying. It\\'s not on you because it\\'s not you. It\\'s the devil. Who, let\\'s not forget, is a certified rotter. I was playing devil\\'s advocate from the get-go. Day one, first debate we ever had, everyone else on the jury, they were saying how the murder was really bad. Prime opportunity... ..for a little DA. I piped up, \"Hey, guys. \"To be fair, we\\'re all going to die one day anyway. \"These people just died a little earlier \"than they would have in the first place. Cut this guy some slack, let him walk.\" Went back to the hotel, I rang my mum up. Said, \"Hey, Mum. \"I played devil\\'s advocate in court today, you\\'d have been proud of me. \"I looked real clever.\" She said, \"Did you lead up to it by saying, \"\\'Just playing devil\\'s advocate\\'?\" I went, \"Should I have?\" She went, \"Undoubtedly. \"Otherwise, it just sounds like your own horrific opinion.\" Day two involved a lot of backpedalling. Had a similar problem with \"no pun intended\". A couple of days later, we\\'re having a debate, I piped up. \"Hey, guys. \"No pun intended, \"but do you think it\\'s possible that the gardener planted evidence?\" So what? So what? Back to my hotel, I rang my mum up. I was like, \"Hey, Mum. \"I said, \\'No pun intended,\\' in court today. You\\'d have been proud of me. \"I looked real clever.\" She said, \"Did you say, \\'No pun intended,\\' \"at the end of the sentence?\" I went, \"I said it at the top.\" She went, \"Right. That does sound like you knew fully well \"you were heading into a pun and did very little to change course. \"Therefore, the pun was fully intended, James.\" What I learnt from those two experiences is, if you make a pun in polite conversation, people will hate you more than that time you openly defended murder. You have been a joy to speak to. Thanks for listening to me. Bye! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE James Acaster. Have you enjoyed yourselves this evening? CHEERING Me too. Thank you so much for listening. Let\\'s hear it again for my tremendous guests - Mr Henning Wehn and James Acaster. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE I\\'ve been Katherine Ryan. I\\'ll see you soon.'"

       "'James Acaster. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE \\nMUSIC PLAYS -Yeah. -LAUGHTER Tonight, I want to tell you about a friend of mine. He works in a casino. And one day, he... Is dice plural and die singular? Or is die plural? Anyway, he killed two people by mistake. Say he\\'s my friend. He\\'s not really my friend. I\\'m on the jury. I shouldn\\'t say friend, should I? They make that very clear. \"He\\'s not your friend, mate.\" I see him every day, he seems like a nice guy. There was someone else called James on the jury. Got confusing. How we got round it, right, everyone would call HIM James One and me Wolf. I got to choose my own name. It\\'s pretty cool. Me and James One hit the town, cutting it up. I was making an effort for once, dressed to impress, I had my best tie on. Paisley, paisley makes the girls go crazily. Walking round. Chatting to a lady at one point. She was lovely. Lovely, lovely lady. She\\'s a masseuse, big respect. I\\'ve tried to give a massage to partners in the past. Not easy, is it? Not sexy massage, drag your minds out the gutter, just normal massage. You know, just normal massage you do in a relationship. You know, normal, just normal. Normal stuff. Normally what? You\\'re normally in bed, ain\\'t you, normally, for a massage with your partner? Normally in bed. End of the day, fair to say. End of the day, bed. Don\\'t do a massage in the morning, that\\'s far too decadent. Save it to the end. Lights out, aren\\'t they? Lying down. Completely dark, ain\\'t it? Just lying there and only one of you knows that a massage is about to take place. If you\\'re not in on it, you\\'re sitting there, you\\'ve got your eyes closed and you\\'re thinking to yourself, \"I\\'m going to go to sleep now. I\\'m going to go to sleep. You\\'re lying there, feeling safe. Just me and the person I trust most in the world. The last thing I\\'m expecting at this point is an ambush. And then, the partner will turn to you...in the dark, like a coward, spineless, and they\\'ll say, \"I\\'ve got a genuine muscular complaint... \"that I really should get seen to by a trained professional. \"However...how would you like to improvise a massage on me \"with your zero expertise?\" \"Would I ever? Let\\'s get this light back on.\" Then the masseuse... ..will assume the position. Which, if you\\'ve ever received a massage from a partner before, you\\'ll know the position in question is sitting on them. Again, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever paid for a professional massage... This move rarely crops up. Park themselves on your lower back - it\\'s too familiar. Get your partner to do it, you get what you pay for, you cheapskate. They\\'re sitting on you, just sitting on you! Just sitting on you. You know, like a bully does. Just sitting on you like a bully. And then, they start guessing. Just... ..having a flying guess all over your back, doing moves they\\'ve half-remembered from films they\\'ve seen. If you can\\'t see what I\\'m doing at the back there, I\\'m just using the heels of my hands. You want to put them either side of the spine and then, you want to put your full weight on that in the hope that that\\'s OK. Wing that, chance it - it\\'s not your back. And just move them out in a pattern that, from where you are, looks nice. It\\'s pleasing to your eye if not to their actual back. Nice and symmetrical all the way up. A bit of shoulder work, obviously. You\\'re not stingy, are you? Some shoulder work while you\\'re there. What you\\'re doing there, just gathering all the skin and muscle... A nice chunky pinch and just let it go and do it again. That\\'s all that is. Letting it go, just move it somewhere else, put it back where it was. That\\'s that move. Like an arcade claw that never wins anything, never gets any toys. No toys. No toys. Hardest part of jury duty. LAUGHTER I\\'ll tell you what it is. The debates. We had to go off, just the jury, in a little room and debate the case every day. Everyone else had opinions, except for me. I felt stupid. In the end, I just played devil\\'s advocate. That\\'s what you do if you don\\'t have an opinion. It\\'s clever. Because devil\\'s advocate, you don\\'t need an opinion. You just say the opposite to what everyone else is saying. It\\'s not on you because it\\'s not you. It\\'s the devil. Who, let\\'s not forget, is a certified rotter. I was playing devil\\'s advocate from the get-go. Day one, first debate we ever had, everyone else on the jury, they were saying how the murder was really bad. Prime opportunity... ..for a little DA. I piped up, \"Hey, guys. \"To be fair, we\\'re all going to die one day anyway. \"These people just died a little earlier \"than they would have in the first place. Cut this guy some slack, let him walk.\" Went back to the hotel, I rang my mum up. Said, \"Hey, Mum. \"I played devil\\'s advocate in court today, you\\'d have been proud of me. \"I looked real clever.\" She said, \"Did you lead up to it by saying, \"\\'Just playing devil\\'s advocate\\'?\" I went, \"Should I have?\" She went, \"Undoubtedly. \"Otherwise, it just sounds like your own horrific opinion.\" Day two involved a lot of backpedalling. Had a similar problem with \"no pun intended\". A couple of days later, we\\'re having a debate, I piped up. \"Hey, guys. \"No pun intended, \"but do you think it\\'s possible that the gardener planted evidence?\" So what? So what? Back to my hotel, I rang my mum up. I was like, \"Hey, Mum. \"I said, \\'No pun intended,\\' in court today. You\\'d have been proud of me. \"I looked real clever.\" She said, \"Did you say, \\'No pun intended,\\' \"at the end of the sentence?\" I went, \"I said it at the top.\" She went, \"Right. That does sound like you knew fully well \"you were heading into a pun and did very little to change course. \"Therefore, the pun was fully intended, James.\" What I learnt from those two experiences is, if you make a pun in polite conversation, people will hate you more than that time you openly defended murder. You have been a joy to speak to. Thanks for listening to me. Bye! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE James Acaster. Have you enjoyed yourselves this evening? CHEERING Me too. Thank you so much for listening. Let\\'s hear it again for my tremendous guests - Mr Henning Wehn and James Acaster'"
