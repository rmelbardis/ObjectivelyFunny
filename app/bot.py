1 : it always seems like the last thing you would want to do is have sex with your ex-wife. Well, I guess that's why I'm here. Because it's the last thing you would want to do. I mean, I‚Ä¶ I've been with a woman for‚Ä¶ thirty years, and she's been beautiful and kind and kind and kind and kind and kind. And I‚Ä¶ I asked her out on a date. She said, "Come on, let's go out and have a drink." And I said, "No, I don't want to. \n
2 : "space‚Äù And so, I just came out to my mom, and my mom was like, ‚ÄúIs there anything you love?‚Äù And she was like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI love the way we speak.‚Äù And‚Ä¶ and I was like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù And she was like, ‚ÄúMay I ask you a question?‚Äù And I was like, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm so sorry", \n
3 : i have never eaten in my life, but sometimes I think I have, and sometimes I think I have‚Ä¶ I think I have a‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nearly a year and a half, and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had a lot of sex. And‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to tell, but‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs almost like an ice cream punch, and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like to think about it, because I‚Äôm too excited. \n
4 : i am a dustbin‚Äù For those of you that don‚Äôt know what dustbin is, it is a collection of dust on a stick that people sit on for hours looking at dust in their underwear. I‚Äôm not even kidding. This right here. It‚Äôs a little side-effect of my upbringing that‚Äôs sort of made me a dustbin. \n
5 : it always seems to be giving voice to someone's biology. That's why I'm seriously considering adoption.  People say to me, "Stewart, you're too old to be adopted."  I stopped breast-feeding at five.  How was your day?  LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE  After hearing that my real parents were budgies, I couldn't look at myself in the mirror.  Yes, I'm a pretty boy. \n
6 : it always seems to have it all. I had to say something. Last night, I went to a karaoke bar that didn't play any '70s music. At first, I was afraid. Oh, I was petrified. I farted in a full lift today which was wrong on so many levels. My dad has a weird hobby. He collects empty bottles which sounds so much better than "alcoholic", doesn't it? I was raised by my father. \n
7 : i know this person‚Äôs got AIDS, so she should‚Äôve got to see it. She‚Äôs got to see for herself, okay? You go to the doctor and he‚Äôll tell you that you‚Äôre infectious. He‚Äôll think that you‚Äôre a horrible person, but that you‚Äôre a clever person. \n
8 : i'm starting to think you're just like the next person to die, you know, you just go get a job. I mean, I saw one of your videos and I was like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the first one to die,‚Äù and then I heard somebody calling in sick with a stomach brace. \n
9 : did you really think I‚Äôm gonna be giving a TED Talk about how the Internet is ruining my life? Do I have to get this over with? I‚Äôm gonna tell you what I wanna do now! I wanna appeal to the best in society! I‚Äôm gonna win this argument. This is for you. No one wants to hear about the worst example of sexual harassment they‚Äôve ever had. And you‚Äôre right. Second Amendment people! Oh, wait. \n
10 : i wish i was young. Now that is a real, real fuck joke. It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt remember it. It‚Äôs just that shit has changed. Some of the shit on that roast is still in the oven, so, I had to replace the wafer with the dryer. You know how that goes. And then, the seats are in the back, the queue is nowhere to be found.''')
