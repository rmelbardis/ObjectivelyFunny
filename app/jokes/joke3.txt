When I was a kid, I thought, "Oh, it must be weird that this is the only time I are allowed to have sex in public." And it seems like in my experience that always happens. But I've noticed, for some reason, that the adults who feel like they have to get out of the way of teenagers are much more confident about that than the kids.
