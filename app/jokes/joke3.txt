Welcome…Are you ready to get in on it? I’m here to do all of this. Just…I’m here to take care of you, and…you know, I’ve had this conversation with my therapist. She’s pretty good about it. And as a young adult in my life. But the conversation that I had with her, she’s gotten really good at, she’s gotten it to a point.
