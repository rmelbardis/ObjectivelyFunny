Welcome, he's over there. – Hey, he wells, he's not over there, cos I think it would be weird if he'd come at all. I think we'd all turn to him, he'd be that tense. – Bye-bye, sir. Now, if you've got any doubt whether or not I do anything, don't feel bad. You'll just have to keep going. You'll have to keep going. You'll have to keep going.
