Welcome to your child’s birthday. I’ll tell you, it’s my birthday. Still at your parents’ house. That’s how you get there. Just hang in there, relax! But… Those of you who are here today, you’re gonna be here for a couple more years. You’re gonna be here for a very long time. You’re gonna be here for, like, a very long time.
