We saw in the previous challenge how to plug a website to our **Prediction API** in order to allow regular users to make prediction.

Now let's create our own website ! ðŸ”¥

We are going to use **Streamlit** which will allow us to create a website very easily and without any web development skills.

## First, let's create another website project

We will create a new project directory for the code of our website.

Again, this directory will be located inside of our *projects directory*: `~/code/<user.github_nickname>`.

Create a new project directory named `TaxiFareWebsite`.

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
mkdir TaxiFareWebsite
cd TaxiFareWebsite
```

Initialise a new git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Create a corresponding repository on our **GitHub** account:

``` bash
gh repo create
```

Go to the GitHub repo in order to make sure that everything is ok:

``` bash
gh browse
```

The repository is empty, which is normal since we have not pushed any code yet...

We are now all set!

## Create a streamlit website

First, we need an `app.py` file inside of our project. The file will contain the code for our page.

``` bash
touch app.py
```

Then, let's copy the `Makefile` that is provided inside of the project... It will allow us to run useful commands for:
- `install_requirements` : dependencies
- `streamlit` : run the **Streamlit** web server in order to see what our website looks like
- `heroku_login` : login to **Heroku**
- `heroku_create_app` : create an app on **Heroku** for our website
- `deploy_heroku` : deploy our app when we are satisfied with its content

You project should look like this:

``` bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â””â”€â”€ app.py
```

Not too overwhelming, right ? ðŸ˜‰

Well... This is half the work.

Lets add some content to our website in `app.py`:

``` python
import streamlit as st

'''
# TaxiFareModel front
'''

st.markdown('''
Remember that there are several ways to output content into your web page...

Either as with the title by just creating a string (or an f-string). Or as with this paragraph using the `st.` functions
''')

'''
## Here we would like to add some controllers in order to ask the user to select the parameters of the ride

1. Let's ask for:
- date and time
- pickup longitude
- pickup latitude
- dropoff longitude
- dropoff latitude
- passenger count
'''

'''
## Once we have these, let's call our API in order to retrieve a prediction

See ? No need to load a `model.joblib` file in this app, we do not even need to know anything about Data Science in order to retrieve a prediction...

ðŸ¤” How could we call our API ? Off course... The `requests` package ðŸ’¡
'''

url = 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict'

if url == 'https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict':

    st.markdown('Maybe you want to use your own API for the prediction, not the one provided by Le Wagon...')

'''

2. Let's build a dictionary containing the parameters for our API...

3. Let's call our API using the `requests` package...

4. Let's retrieve the prediction from the **JSON** returned by the API...

## Finally, we can display the prediction to the user
'''
```

Let's run the **Streamlit** web server and see what our website looks like:

``` bash
make streamlit
```

We have a website of our own running on our machine ðŸŽ‰

## Now we want to plug our API to the website

... So that users can actually make some predictions!

ðŸ‘‰ Let's follow the instructions inside the web page and replace the content with some `requests` package magic and a call to our API!

ðŸ‘‰ Again, alternatively, you may use this Le Wagon **Prediction API** if you you do not have one in production:

https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/

https://taxifare.lewagon.ai/predict?pickup_datetime=2012-10-06%2012:10:20&pickup_longitude=40.7614327&pickup_latitude=-73.9798156&dropoff_longitude=40.6513111&dropoff_latitude=-73.8803331&passenger_count=2

Let's inspect `app.py` and check what is being done inside...

Replace the URL to the prediction API with your own and update the code accordingly.

Now let's get crazy with the page content ðŸŽ‰

Maybe add some map ðŸ—º

Once we are satisfied, let's push the code to production! ðŸ”¥

## Deploy

Now that we checked our app works locally, we might want it to run free on a remote server.

We will see once again how **Heroku** is easy to use, here we simply need to:

Copy the provided `Procfile` and `setup.sh` inside of our project.

Are we not missing something ?

ðŸ¤” How are the packages that `app.py` is using going to be installed on **Heroku** ?

We need to add a `setup.py`, a `MANIFEST.in`, and a `requirements.txt` containing the name of the required packages to our project! We also need a `Procfile` and a `setup.sh` in order for Heroku to know how to run our website. As well as a `Makefile` to ease the use of the command line.

Let's copy the files provided in the challenge to your web project...

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong> ðŸ’¡ Hint: how to copy `setup.py` and other provided files to the web project ? </strong></summary>

``` bash
cp -r ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/data-challenges/07-Data-Engineering/05-User-interface/02-Streamlit-for-restitution/* ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/TaxiFareWebsite
```

</details>

The project should now look like this:

``` bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ MANIFEST.in
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â””â”€â”€ setup.sh
```

Now, we can login to **Heroku**

``` bash
heroku login
```

Upload the **public** SSH key created during the setup in order to authentify to **Heroku** using SSH

``` bash
heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Create an app for our website on **Heroku**... Remember the app name should be unique on the internet.

ðŸ’¡ You might want to [change the region](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/regions) if you are not located inside of Europe...

```bash
heroku create --ssh-git YOUR_APP_NAME --region eu
```

Remember that **Heroku** uses git in order to retrieve the files of your project to put in production.

ðŸ‘‰ You need to `git add` and `git commit` the files of your project that you want to push to production before pushing your code to **Heroku**

``` bash
git add --all
git commit -m "code ready to be deployed to production"
```

Finally, we can push our website to **Heroku** ðŸš€

```bash
git push heroku master
```

Then scale it:

```bash
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

Click on the link provided by the command line `https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/` and you should access to your website ðŸŽ‰
